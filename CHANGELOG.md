# Changelog

## 4.2.1 - Tame acquisition activity and permission compatibility

- Added `tamework:tame_acquired` for successful wild-to-tamed interactions. This activity works without managed-content mappings. Legacy ownership-claim and mapped tame activities keep their existing behavior.

- Fixed a startup collision with LuckPerms when another plugin registers the lowercase `admin` group. Tamework and its bundled Beacon commands now use that same group spelling during setup, before Hytale snapshots virtual groups; permission nodes and access checks are unchanged.

## 4.2.0 - Companion Views and Stability - 2026-09-23

- Fixed Revive and Recover on ordinary companion cards when a linked animal's old NPC ID was retired after death or loss.

- Fixed startup failing when an unfinished death or lost transition was superseded by later companion changes. Recovery now retires the obsolete pending operation while preserving the companion's current saved state.

- Expanded automatic persistence failure reports with nested error codes and bounded, anonymized operation and related-record evidence, including failures during startup. Reports preserve collection limits and unavailable evidence so support can diagnose more failures without requesting a save.

- Added `/tw debug clear-owned` to preview and permanently clear a player's ordinary animals, including unloaded, dead, and lost entries. Protected stored and bonded companions are preserved.

- Added player-shared saved views for ordinary command flutes, with combined species, group, and selected-only filters. Each flute reopens to its own selected view and keeps its own unsaved draft. Filters can be added or edited one at a time, and the save icon flashes cream and amber for unsaved changes. Panel refreshes and status-tab changes preserve those edits until the view is saved or reopened. Select all matching works across pages, while page controls appear only when more pages exist.
- Named saved views appear in the flute's item name. The item tooltip shows the saved filters with colored labels above the normal description; unsaved menu edits leave it unchanged until saved.
- Ordinary command flutes can offer configurable icon choices. Each physical flute keeps its own chosen icon, while its held model, selected view, and command settings remain unchanged.

- Added companion-menu pagination with 50 cards per page by default. Server owners can choose 1–100 in `/tw settings`. Ordinary flute menus build detailed cards only for the selected page, while search, status tabs, sorting, and group selection cover the full roster.

- Reduced companion-menu page-change work by indexing registered portrait icons instead of scanning every item for each card.

- Ordinary companion pages now reuse their card controls across page changes, including shorter last pages. Removed unused XP-ring widgets and hidden location updates, and shared trait reads within each card build to reduce work on first loads as well.

- Reduced companion-menu refresh cost by sharing profile and flute data within each refresh, building owned cards once, and using indexed discovery instead of scanning every loaded entity. Happiness meters and tooltips share one calculation, population checks resolve families only for nearby roles, and saved-card extension lookups stay within the requested companion. Countdown-only updates reuse existing card data until expiration.

## 4.1.3 - Stored Companions and Coop Stability - 2026-09-20

- Cooped companions now retain saved health for their cards. Captured companions
  show editable groups and retain their flute's remembered selection while stored.

- Added a Welcome and announcements toggle in `/tw settings` to disable all
  automatic welcome and update popups. `/tw news` remains available.

- Fixed a world crash introduced in 4.1 when coop production tried to save progress
  for an animal with a quarantined persistence operation. Unfinished coop operations
  now block production, and rejected saves suspend the affected animal's production.
- Fixed newly tamed animals disappearing from the companion panel when unloaded before being linked to a flute.

## 4.1.2 - Companion Panel Fixes - 2026-09-19

- Fixed freshly tamed animals appearing unselected in the companion panel after selection.
- Fixed managed animals spawned with `/tw npc spawn tamed` being excluded from the companion panel.
- Added `/tw debug set lifestage <baby|adolescent|adult|prime|senior>` with
  standard NPC selectors. The existing life-stage query now reports adult aging stages.
- Added `/tw debug set harvestready [--mode=true|false|toggle]` with standard NPC
  selectors. Ready mode clears the configured harvest alarm; false restarts the
  role's normal harvest cooldown.

## 4.1.1 - UI Texture Optimization - 2026-09-19

- Reduced nine life-stage and trait UI textures from 1254x1254 to 32x32,
  lowering their client texture-atlas usage by over 99.9% while preserving transparency.

## 4.1.0 - Animal Progression and Companion UI - 2026-09-19

- Old-age deaths are now permanent, even with revives enabled, including bonded
  companions. They free owned capacity and cannot be revived later.

- New or unspecified needs resource-search settings now default to Auto Fast.
  Existing explicit choices stay unchanged.

- Experience presets now set aging, animal progression/offline policy, and the
  combined needs-damage rule explicitly. Simplified disables adult aging, Easier
  freezes at prime, and Full Experience/Hardcore use full aging; only Hardcore
  enables old-age death. Switching presets no longer carries those values over.

- Refreshed the Companion Guide and its example cards for per-flute selection,
  shared groups, captured-animal trading, and Hardcore server rules in all six languages.

- Companion status tabs show matching animal counts and a clearer selected highlight.
  Right-click a group to add its animals to your current selection; left-click selects
  only that group. Fixed the menu logo tooltip stretching off-screen.

- Reworked ordinary command flutes around one owned-companion panel. Owned animals
  appear automatically, each flute keeps its own selected set, and the
  panel separates In World, Stored, Lost / Dead, and All views with selected rows
  first. Nearby-only filtering and one name/species/group search keep browsing
  independent from command recipients. Player-owned groups are shared across
  compatible flutes, support multiple memberships, and can be edited inline.
  Captures already tracked by a flute or carried in your inventory remain visible
  as read-only stored cards when capture clears ownership.

- Added a Hardcore settings preset with old-age death, disabled revives and recall teleportation, and
  starvation/dehydration damage of 10%/15% of maximum health per minute.
  Standard presets restore revives and recall teleportation and disable old-age death.
- Selecting an experience preset now fills the settings form immediately; Apply
  still saves changes. Removed Load Preset and widened the dropdown so the
  Simplified (Minecraft-like) label has room.

- Fixed a companion-panel disconnect when portrait-star updates overtook a
  queued card-list refresh.

- Fixed companions being marked lost and refusing capture when Hytale removes a duplicate entity while the original remains alive.

- Captured companions keep their linked-panel cards until a different player
  successfully releases and acquires them. The former owner's links are then
  removed, including after later recapture; failed releases preserve the cards.

- Movement-speed refreshes now stop safely if the tame component registration becomes invalid.

- Recall no longer restores a dead saved body while its death transition is pending.
- Unloaded NPC cards keep a visible health-bar background even when saved health is zero.
- Captured age meters now gray out consistently, and paused meters show a larger
  transparent pause icon centered over the bar, with equal-width strokes.
- Coordinate copy buttons sit immediately left of the coordinates, and opening
  the selectable field keeps its hint directly below it.
- Startup recovery defers death and ownership-release operations blocked by an
  unfinished population admission, preserving their records instead of preventing
  the entire world from starting.

- Flat UI symbols now use white textures with explicit display tints. Shaded
  artwork and symbols with contrasting internal details retain their original textures.
- Unloaded and captured animal cards keep the normal card height, with location
  details and coordinate copying above the meters. Captured timers retain their
  remaining times with pause symbols; unloaded timers use saved progression time.

- Moved spawn-marker deletion to `/tw debug delete-spawn-marker`, outside the view menu.
- Reject invalid debug toggle and NPC marker values, and keep named world options
  out of positional command arguments. Corrected outdated command examples.

- Fixed queued births ignoring growth sizes and durations for animal families without an explicit ID.

- Command-item configs can hide the command-control strip with
  `HotswapHudEnabled: false` while keeping the animal information HUD visible.

- Added shared Animal Progression settings for needs, aging, harvest readiness,
  and breeding readiness. Server upgrades preserve each existing owner-offline
  policy while migrating it into the version 2 settings document.
- Added optional role-scoped adult aging through `TwBreedingConfig.Aging`, with
  real eligible-minute durations, prime freezing by default, configurable full
  lifecycle and old-age death, and lifecycle status/yield UI text.
- Command menus and the target HUD show compact age, breeding, and harvest
  meters. Age shows progress within the current life stage; countdowns use
  hours and minutes, switching to seconds below one minute.
- Fixed cooldown refreshes stretching compact meters. HUD meters now align
  with the needs bars, and juvenile age countdowns name the next life stage.
- Added distinct life-stage icons and restored the HUD harvest icon. Command-panel
  icons sit beside their meters with consistent sizing and tighter gaps. Meter
  icons use flat white source textures so dynamic tints match their fill colors
  in both the panel and HUD.
- Juveniles hide breeding controls and timers, and reach adulthood without
  an extra offspring breeding cooldown. Normal breeding requirements still apply.
- Unloaded farms are not force-loaded or background-simulated. Needs and trough
  consumption pause while unloaded; aging progresses normally without care
  penalties, and harvest or breeding readiness remains bounded to one ready
  result until a loaded world can complete the physical action.
- Managed coops catch up production from saved active animal time, with bounded
  work and container capacity limits. Captured storage pauses these intervals.
- Fixed shared progression time advancing faster on servers with multiple worlds.

- Reduced database growth from repeated entity checkpoints by compacting old,
  consumed checkpoint history while preserving current saves and retry safety.
- Added `/tw debug persistence compact` to reclaim database disk space while the
  server stays online, temporarily pausing Tamework saves during maintenance.
  New and compacted databases also reclaim space incrementally.
- Database compaction now builds its temporary copy beside the save database,
  avoiding failures caused by a hosting provider's separate system temp-storage limit.

- Added an optional captured-item display API for plugin-provided tooltip
  prefixes and item rarity. Tamework preserves the quality through capture
  delivery and clears it on release; integrating packs own the rating policy.

- Release now removes loaded companions immediately instead of waiting for an
  NPC despawn timer that can stall when the animal is not ticking.

- Fixed nested NPC and debug commands reading command names as arguments, including
  traits, ownership, tamed state, alarm lookup, avatar tools, logging, and spawn views.
  Updated their usage hints to match the current command paths.

- Removed the unused `ItemFeatureConfig` whistle settings from the Java API.
  Integrations must remove calls to `isWhistleEnabled()`, `getWhistleRadius()`,
  `Builder.whistleEnabled(...)`, and `Builder.whistleRadius(...)` when rebuilding.

- Integrations can apply tool-based harvest conversions and chain shearing to one
  nearby eligible owned animal. Harvest and cull activities include the acting
  player and captured tool so profession bonuses use the tool that performed the action.

- Portrait quality ratings now use gold star images at the top-right, without a tooltip.
  Animal capacity appears on the controls row.

- The standard animal panel can display optional plugin-provided portrait stars
  and a capacity summary, using detached traits from live and saved animals.

- Companion happiness tooltips now explain current, base, and target values, with
  colored active effects and a gray list of inactive configured effects.
- Added a read-only saved trait page API for owner-scoped companion lists.
- Size trait tooltips now show the resolved meat and hide yield bonus.

## 4.0.0 - Companion Commands, Formations, and Localization - 2026-09-14

- Flying followers now approach as a loose group with hitbox-based spacing,
  gradual slowdown, and tolerance for small player movements and height changes.

- Restored GNU GPLv3 with an attribution clause and removed the private-server licensing template.

**Upgrade compatibility:** Dependent mods whose manifests require Tamework
below `4.0.0` need a compatible update before installing this release. Pack
authors must migrate inline spawner icon maps to `TwDynamicIconConfig`; see the
[dynamic icon migration reference](wiki/Modder-Documentation/Config-Reference/TwDynamicIconConfig-Reference.md).

- Inline companion locations now show rounded north/south and east/west distances
  from the player in the same world. Captured cards use the heading "Captured".

- Chevron birds now approach exchanged formation slots smoothly while keeping their fixed V shape.

- Restored recall progress on unloaded companion cards with inline locations,
  including Owned cards. Recall logs now identify automatic recovery retries,
  and rejected links explain when the command tool does not allow that companion type.

- Added localized trait descriptions below command-panel tooltips, with effect amounts and configurable direction/value placeholders.

- Fixed active/inactive, breeding, and unlink notifications showing `{0}` instead of the companion's name, and boolean config errors missing the field label.

- Fixed linked companion controls retaining an old target after Lost recovery,
  requiring the panel to be closed and reopened before toggling active status.

- Attachment display labels and values now support language keys in the target HUD and captured-item tooltips, preserving each viewer's language.

- Completed translations for menus, HUDs, tooltips, command help and responses
  across all six supported languages. Captured-item labels now retain language
  keys so each viewer can see their own translation.

- Polished inline location details with a World label, named coordinate axes,
  and a copy icon that reveals selectable coordinates; removed observation timestamps.

- Added a Companion Guide through the command menu's Help button, with eleven
  topics, read-only example cards, and language keys for all supported locales.

- Captured, cooped, and unloaded companions now show location details directly
  on Linked and Owned cards. Capture sightings name their item and storage
  container when known, with last-seen details and generic labels for older sightings.

- Refreshed Locate with a compact layout that hides unused status and coordinate
  sections while preserving container locations and last-seen details.

- Fixed newly linked companions appearing unloaded after death when their saved
  profile had not finished publishing.

- Companion removal now keeps its heading and actions together, with a Back arrow
  and named confirmations before releasing or culling an animal.

- Linking and admin spawning now save full companion checkpoints for offline
  card details and Recall recovery. Recall progress no longer overlaps action captions.

- Added a development prototype for companion groups that follow the player without rotating or surrounding them, plus bounded slot exchanges for companion, ground, and flying formations to reduce crossing after animals become mixed up. Companion follow spacing now uses individual hitbox sizes with a small gap, keeping mixed-size groups more compact. Non-combat Defend also uses formations, while Animal Husbandry offers Follow Close for the original following behavior. Fixed restored or interrupted player-flock memberships surviving commands such as Idle and Follow Close.

- Restyled command HUD icons as cream glyphs, with distinct Follow and Recall
  symbols, while preserving their existing texture sizes.

- Roster flight controls now keep their input binding and button state during
  unrelated live card refreshes, matching the normal companion panel.

- Enlarged bonded roster portraits and made them follow role morphs, including
  elemental variants, for active and stored companions.

- Updated embedded Beacon to 2.0.2, reducing its consent and report header
  texture footprint to save UI atlas space.

- Smoothed flock formation turns and position changes, capped formation flight turning at 90 degrees/second, and staggered loose flock heights above and below the leader. Followers also match most of their formation slot's turn movement, reducing catch-up lag while retaining some flexibility.

- Locate now reports recorded coop coordinates and tracks capture items in player
  inventories, standard storage containers, and dropped items. Offline or unloaded
  holders show a last-seen result; tracking uses item events instead of periodic scans.

- Added optional loose and chevron flight formations for native NPC flocks, with configurable spacing and tightness. Formation steering follows the current flying leader and uses existing obstacle avoidance.

- Added `TameworkMaintainDistance` for peaceful target-relative positioning and
  `TameworkInteractionActive` to select entities running a named root interaction.
  These support the Alec's Cats teaser wand without combat targeting or stored play state.

- Rebuilt bonded roster cards around portraits, full-width names, health and
  progression, with clear summon, dismiss, revival, and session status. Roster
  companions omit care meters and use one toolbar for state tabs, sorting,
  name search, and active-capacity information. Action buttons pair icons with
  labels, duration and cooldown bars span the action section, and permanent
  deletion can be cancelled directly from the card.

- Normal and bonded roster cards share companion portraits with capture items
  through role-based `TwDynamicIconConfig` assets. Appearance variants no longer
  require a spawner config. Icon-only display items reuse existing textures.
  Dependent packs and icon tooling must migrate the removed inline spawner maps.
- Icon generation can retain fixed minor attachments without multiplying variants.
  The renderer preserves the animal body for empty skins and glow/detail layers,
  and the generator accepts source directories containing exclamation marks.

- NPC names span the companion card header, with a small increase in card height
  for comfortable spacing below the header and full names available on hover.

- Refined group shortcuts and NPC group selectors with shared color diamonds,
  neutral borders, wider shortcut rows, and a compact group-edit button.

- Matched the remaining Tamework dialogs, config editor, talent tree, bonded cards,
  and flight/control HUD frames to the shared charcoal style without adding textures.

- Restyled the settings menu to match the charcoal command panel, with clearer
  sections, roomier controls, and shared textures. Centered its close icon and
  added an amber unsaved-changes warning with flashing warning icons below Apply.
  Failed validation or saving keeps the entered settings available for correction.

- Capturing companions preserves exact health values for their saved gray health bars.
- Fixed the Feedback button crashing the world when another mod embeds Beacon.

- Companion cards use compact status emblems for dead, lost, unloaded, captured,
  and coop states, centered in the action section regardless of visible buttons,
  keeping saved details and action controls visible.

- Fixed active-highlight helpers retaining an invalid mount after their NPC is
  removed, which could crash the world while preparing mount updates.

- Added Happiness, Hunger, and Thirst sorting, with the lowest known care
  percentage first and unknown values last, including inactive companions.

- Owners can spend or reset talent points for dead and lost companions with a
  complete saved restoration snapshot. Purchases carry through revival and recovery.

- Removal mode preserves group, active, talent, and cooldown controls. Dead cards
  retain talent indicators and an empty health bar, with saved maximum health
  when available. The command menu uses the shared X icon to close.

- Trait icons match the charcoal HUD and command panel; removed unused custom UI
  textures to reduce their shared texture-atlas footprint.

- The command menu has a Feedback button that opens Beacon’s issue and suggestion form.

- Capturing and releasing a companion preserves its harvest cooldown instead of
  making it harvestable immediately.

- Named NPCs show their role beneath their HUD name. Food preferences have a
  heading and appear before appearance attributes; level text fits its digits.

- Command HUDs retry their join-time activation after the client finishes loading,
  so an already-equipped flute does not need to be put away and reselected.

- The target HUD matches the charcoal command menu, with readable health and
  needs meters, breeding and harvest cooldown/readiness bars, and compact
  appearance labels such as `Coat: Brown`.

- The command menu includes a settings cog for players allowed to use `/tw settings`.
  Fixed the cog texture reference.
- Dead, lost, and unloaded companion cards retain available saved stats, traits,
  progression, and care indicators. Saved values are muted and labeled as last known;
  unavailable saved cooldown timing is shown as unknown.

- Companion cards keep breeding and harvest readiness visible after cooldowns.
  Breeding indicators dim and explain low happiness or disabled breeding.
  Harvest capability uses effective role parameters and variant overrides, including sheep shearing.
  Computed role values use an initialized expression scope; failed optional
  harvest lookups cannot crash the world tick.
  Refined level/talent controls and command/group selector alignment; level
  buttons fit their digit count and talent buttons retain a distinct hover state.
  Dropdown popups reuse the shared frame to stand apart from underlying cards.
  Panel controls share one header row, group editing and color-coded shortcuts
  live in the sidebar, and traits/progression sit slightly above the health bar.

- Existing NPCs now fill missing random attachment sets when they load, using
  the model's normal weights. Saved choices and explicit attachment migrations
  take priority, including intentional invisible options such as `None`.

- Replaced the command wheel with a compact LMB/Q/E/R assignment sidebar and
  Linked, Nearby, and Owned tabs. The charcoal companion panel separates
  identity, traits and stacked meters, and captioned actions into fixed columns.
  Unavailable companions put their status beside the relevant action, and
  disabled needs remain hidden.
- Linked cards assign groups directly from a dropdown with a group-colored
  border. Traits and level share the row above a thicker, higher-contrast
  health bar with a soft text shadow. Named companions show their role below
  their name, and active toggles sit above group selection. Level and available
  talent points use matching button controls. Group shortcuts sit below the command assignments, and the
  header shows the Tamework logo and current mode count. Auto-Link and
  Highlight Active share one row.
- Action buttons now reuse two frame textures and sixteen glyphs, replacing the
  separate baked state images to reduce UI texture use.

- Disabled needs now count as full hunger and thirst for happiness, including
  eligible husbandry care bonuses, so breeding remains reachable.

- Companion action icons now share matching normal and hovered button frames.
  The red X opens Release and Unlink in every generic panel mode, plus Cull for
  loaded living animals. Release replaces Abandon, including off-screen cleanup.

- Owned mode now offers Recall, Locate, and Revive/Recover for unlinked generic
  companions, using verified ownership and the existing recovery rules.

- Release and Cull hide the clicked companion card immediately while
  the saved state updates. Unconfirmed removals return after five seconds.

- Fixed managed admin spawns without a held command item failing to save their
  profiles. Recovery now isolates uncertain single-animal admissions while keeping
  their capacity reserved, and safely narrows matching older owner-wide locks.

- Added missing happiness food and caretaking labels in German, French, Canadian
  French, and Brazilian Portuguese.

- Fixed Release and Cull being blocked by another animal's owner-level
  recovery quarantine. Protected animals remain blocked, and failed removals show feedback.

- Fixed startup failing when uncertain population operations were already safely
  quarantined. Recovery preserves those records and allows unrelated work to load.

- Added Owned to the command-item mode selector. It shows owned animals regardless
  of item links, including saved animals in other worlds and unloaded chunks.
  Unlinked off-screen animals can be released to free ownership-limit slots.

- Husbandry providers can supply an unconditional `happinessFlatBonus` for
  `HAPPINESS_CARE` with capability `HUSBANDRY_FLAT_CARE_BONUS`. It adds 0-100
  happiness points without condition or disposition scaling. Existing provider
  constructors retain their conditional bonuses and default the flat bonus to zero.

- Command HUD, companion-card and settings tooltips use the game's default
  tooltip style. The command HUD uses the native panel frame, and happiness
  tooltips combine active Care bonuses into one Caretaking total.
- Renamed the visible Disposition trait to Attitude. Level tooltips now show
  flat happiness contributions in points instead of percentages, including
  separate Attitude and talent amounts. Saved trait IDs remain unchanged.
- Fixed culling leaving saved animals counted against population limits. Owned
  animals are permanently released from saved population tracking before
  slaughter completes, without creating a revivable companion.
- Added opt-in flat disposition, additive happiness talents, conditional Care
  happiness providers and single-food-effect replacement. Existing trait scores,
  talent purchases and effect deadlines are preserved; packs that do not opt in
  retain multiplier disposition and their existing food stacking policy.

## 3.4.5 - Companion Recovery and Happiness Hotfix - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Happiness rings in the linked NPC panel and target HUD now show a thin red
  marker at the NPC's configured breeding happiness requirement, with the
  required happiness on the next line of the breeding toggle tooltip.

### Fixed

- Timed feeding, petting, and damage happiness effects now remain separate from
  the animal's underlying mood until they expire. Refreshing does not stack an
  effect, and expiration no longer deducts a bonus that already faded. Underlying
  mood is preserved at the happiness limits, through save/reload, and through
  capture/release with the original effect expiry times. On first
  update, older saves retain current happiness and clear legacy effect timers.
- Fixed captured companions from older saves failing to release when their
  saved ownership record has no world name.
- Fixed older captured items remaining blocked when Tamework starts after the
  worlds have loaded and misses the initial loaded-companion identity scan.

## 3.4.4 - Variant Taming Hotfix - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- Restored breed-specific taming roles when a variant declares its own
  `TamedRoleId`, preventing bobtail cats from becoming mediumhair cats after
  capture and release.

## 3.4.3 - Beacon Consent Hotfix - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Updated embedded Beacon to 2.0.1 to fix consent row toggles and keep the
  Enabled checkbox synchronized with the selected telemetry types.

## 3.4.2 - Breeding and Recall Hotfix - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Added missing breeding and avatar-flight debug logging commands. Every
  `TwDebugConfig` debug mode now has a runtime command toggle.
- Fixed explicit debug toggle arguments for despawn, flying companions, needs
  telemetry, and respawn tracing after the command reorganization.
- Fixed manual and automatic breeding failing for ordinary animals, including
  Alec's Cats and Alec's Animal Husbandry animals.
- Recall can restore an eligible missing companion from its exact saved
  checkpoint when Update 6 confirms that no source entity section exists.

## 3.4.1 - Beacon Runtime Migration - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Replaced the Alec's Telemetry runtime with Beacon `2.0.0`. This is a breaking
  namespace and command change for integrations; use `com.alechilles.beacon`
  and `/beacon consent`.
- Updated the embedded Patchwork runtime to `1.4.1` so Tamework and Patchwork
  share the Beacon runtime.

## 3.4.0 - Persistence Diagnostics and Schema Compatibility - 2026-08-31

### Added

- When Tamework telemetry and `Diag` consent are enabled, terminal persistence
  failures now send a bounded, redacted debug database package with the error
  classification.
  This includes generic and bonded persistence startup, read, write,
  checkpoint, runtime, and shutdown failures.
- Added `/tw debug persistence simulateerror` for a harmless, console-safe
  end-to-end diagnostic test. It does not change persistence data.

### Changed

- Updated the embedded Patchwork runtime to 1.4.0. Asset patches can now use
  an empty path with safe object-merge operations to merge the document root.
- Persistence diagnostics now use the direct `/tw debug persistence
  status|health|detail|export` commands.
- Automatic persistence reports run outside the storage path and use a bounded
  queue. They never block or change the result of a persistence operation.
- Disabling Tamework telemetry remains the opt-out for all automatic Tamework
  persistence diagnostics.
- Automatic persistence diagnostics now use the independent `Diag` consent
  category. Error consent does not enable or disable these reports. Existing
  projects that already reviewed consent must select Save and Close in
  `/telemetry consent` before Diagnostics can run. A report that cannot enter
  the telemetry queue remains eligible on the next matching failure.

### Fixed

- Temporary mount parking can no longer replace a companion's saved role with
  `Empty_Role`. Existing companions keep their canonical role, and Tamework
  waits for a real role before it creates a new saved profile.
- Dead or lost companions whose saved state contains Hytale's temporary
  `Empty_Role` mount role can now be restored with their canonical companion
  role.
- Avatar Flight now keeps the transformed player and hidden companion below
  Hytale's maximum entity height. Reaching the build ceiling no longer removes
  the companion or ends the flight with a missing source.
- If an Avatar Flight source is missing, cleanup now returns the player to the
  last recorded safe-ground position instead of an unsafe airborne origin.
- A failed persistence request no longer disables unrelated companion actions
  unless Tamework detects database corruption, an incompatible schema, or an
  unresolved commit outcome.
- Existing replacement databases from Tamework 3.2.x now upgrade to the
  expanded persistence schema without deleting profiles or resetting player
  data. The upgrade creates a verified sibling backup before it changes the
  database.

## 3.3.1 - Embedded Telemetry Metadata Hotfix - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- Needs telemetry no longer enables the needs-resource hot-path INFO summary.
  Release builds keep privacy-safe needs telemetry without writing a diagnostic
  line every 30 seconds.
- Corrected the embedded Alec's Telemetry version metadata. Tamework now
  reports the concrete runtime version `1.2.3` in shaded builds.
- Persistence reads now use one consistent SQLite snapshot. Concurrent coop
  capture or release no longer causes a false profile mismatch that disables
  other companion capture and release actions until restart.

## 3.3.0 - Public API and Husbandry Runtime Update - 2026-08-30

### Added

- Added the stable `2.0.0` public Java API contract. It includes custom command
  page and command HUD renderers, namespaced contributors, partial-update
  hints, command-page actions and flows, redacted diagnostics, and standard UI
  fallback.
- Added a durable population-group owned count for integrations that must
  include unloaded, dead, and lost companions in capacity checks.
- Generic command panels can permanently abandon owned companions. This
  releases their durable owner capacity and tool links, including when the
  companion is unloaded, dead, or lost.
- Managed activity profiles can map authorized `TameworkCullNpc` item
  interactions to a domestic drop list and a `tamework:cull_success` Activity
  V2 event. Profiles that omit the mapping keep the normal cull death drops
  and publish no cull activity.
- Revised the capability-gated `husbandryOutcomes()` API. One optional provider
  can adjust needs decay, happiness disposition, harvest and cull output, and
  parent breeding cooldowns. Tamework keeps ownership of random rolls and
  game-state changes.

### Changed

- Prerelease API change: the Husbandry outcomes contract is now `2.0.0`.
  Providers built against the earlier development preview must replace
  `CARE_RESTORATION` and `PRODUCT_BONUS` with the new outcome kinds and use the
  five-field `HusbandryOutcomeModifiers` record. The preview's four-field
  constructor and old multiplier accessors are not part of the released API.
- Clearing a companion owner through the owner-population transition now
  commits the terminal `RELEASED` lifecycle and clears its durable capacity
  claims and command-tool links in the same transaction.
- Companion harvests, passive animal products, filled containers, and cull
  rewards now share one finalized-output boundary before Activity V2 reports
  their produced item quantities.

### Fixed

- Companion attack and defend sensors no longer remove the companion when the
  marked owner is a player. Threat checks now use the candidate NPC's attitude
  toward the owner.
- Revive-ready updates now correlate replacement death snapshots with the
  current lifecycle revision. Interrupted updates no longer block Tamework
  startup because of a stale snapshot revision.
- Dead companions now release deployed capacity. Companions affected by the
  older stale-capacity behavior can revive without a database reset.
- Managed companions can now revive through owner-scoped capacity admission.
- Revival failures now identify the failed stage and write the diagnostic
  cause to the server log.
- Owner-clearing capture items can capture both ordinarily tamed companions
  and managed-admission companions without failing lifecycle admission.
- Captured companions that predate population-group classification can now
  create their first managed group assignment when released.
- Dead managed companions that predate population tracking can now initialize
  their group and owned or deployed domain claims when revived.

## 3.2.3 - Stable 0.6 Compatibility Hotfix - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- Updated the embedded Creditor library to 1.1.1 for stable Hytale 0.6 support.

### Fixed

- Updated the build target to stable Hytale `0.6.0`. The Update 5 chunk-save
  fallback now binds the removed `WorldChunk.toHolder()` method only on an
  Update 5 runtime.

## 3.2.2 - Flightmaster's Talisman Preview Hotfix - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- Fixed the Flightmaster's Talisman crafting preview. It now uses the
  front-facing icon orientation and a smaller scale.

## 3.2.1 - Runtime Performance and Active Companion Indicators - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Added `/tw debug persistence reviveready` for server staff to submit
  revive-ready updates for all dead generic linked companions owned by the
  caller. The command asks the caller to retry if linked roster data is still
  updating.
- Added optional bonded roster `ReviveCooldownSeconds`. It defaults to `0`, so
  existing bonded companions can still revive immediately unless a roster sets
  a positive cooldown.
- Added `TameworkCullNpc`, a reusable item interaction that lets a player cull
  an eligible owned and tamed NPC without opening a command panel. Consumer
  mods control the item, hold time, and other item behavior.
- Added optional per-tool `Highlight Active` indicators for generic linked
  panels on Update 6. The controller sees group-colored indicators above loaded
  active companions. Ungrouped companions use neutral gold. The setting is
  disabled by default.
- Added privacy-safe persistence throughput diagnostics and slow-needs profiler
  correlation breadcrumbs. Diagnostics exclude player names, companion IDs,
  and saved payloads.

### Changed

- Persistence maintenance now coalesces and bounds latest-state work while
  preserving critical checkpoint, flush, shutdown, and recovery work.
- Large companion groups now spread needs work across world ticks and reuse
  resource snapshots, successful path checks, compiled settings, and bounded
  population searches.
- The release manifest now supports stable Hytale versions from `0.5.0` up to,
  but not including, `0.7.0`.

### Fixed

- Active companion indicators now handle Update 6 particle requirements,
  restored companions, tool changes, duplicate prevention, invalid anchors,
  and mount transitions. Update 5 does not run this feature.
- Fixed command hotswap HUD cleanup during world transfers.
- Grounded flying companions now hand off correctly to the Walk controller.

## 3.2.0 - Runtime Activation and Performance Update - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- Revival activities now include the companion role and managed population
  groups when Tamework can resolve them, so progression integrations can apply
  the correct animal-family policy. The API advertises this contract through
  `REVIVAL_ACTIVITY_CONTEXT`.
- Tamework now builds one startup activation plan from effective content,
  dependency requirements, public capability requests, and durable recovery
  evidence. Unused modules install no runtime systems, feature listeners,
  workers, or persistence runtime.
- `/tw activation` now reports module states, reasons, passive work counters,
  and whether changed content requires a restart. Reloads do not change the
  live system topology.
- Generic and bonded persistence now use separate read-only startup probes.
  Empty servers do not create their databases, while pending durable work
  keeps its required recovery authority active.
- Moved enabled Tamework sample NPCs, items, progression configs,
  translations, and example-only art into a separate disabled-by-default
  `Alec's Tamework! Examples` asset pack. Bundled examples no longer activate
  Tamework runtime modules on servers that do not install the pack.
- Reusable avatar-flight, tranquilizer, and attachment-display assets no
  longer count as active gameplay by themselves. Library-only servers do not
  register their avatar-flight, mount, projectile-hazard, attachment, movement,
  or companion-core tick systems.
- Active companion attachment, movement, flight-control, and despawn sweeps
  now reuse per-world scratch collections instead of allocating new candidate
  lists and sets on every pass.
- Captured spawner tooltips now show a compact companion summary, level and maximum level, trait
  names with color-coded values, and a separate appearance section. Gender markers use pink
  for female companions and blue for male companions.

### Fixed

- Manual breeding now explains animal breeding cooldown, happiness, maturity, state, mate,
  capacity, integration, and pending-birth failures instead of failing
  without player feedback.
- Update 6 pre-release clients no longer reject Tamework because the active
  NPC indicator now supplies the particle animation data that Update 6
  requires.
- Update 5 servers no longer register or emit active NPC indicators because
  the feature requires Update 6 model-particle cleanup support.
- Active NPC indicators now use the base indicator timing pattern, with a very
  short particle overlap that prevents an empty frame between animation waves.
- World transfers no longer disconnect players who have the command hotswap HUD active.
- Reduced persistence stalls with large companion populations. Spawner
  releases and Recall no longer wait behind unrelated projection events or
  repeated older live-state snapshots. Profile and checkpoint maintenance now
  use bounded, newest-state queues while unload and destructive-removal
  checkpoints keep priority.
- Added privacy-safe persistence throughput diagnostics. They report queue
  counts, merged work, batch acknowledgements, and pending age without player
  names, companion IDs, or saved payloads.
- Restored the shared Nametag and Soul Lantern models, textures, icons,
  particles, and audio to the main Tamework pack. Dependent mods no longer
  require the optional examples pack to validate these reusable assets.
- Preserved system declaration order inside each active runtime module. Avatar
  Flight no longer fails startup when its HUD registers before its movement
  dependency.
- Tamework now registers its NPC builders before generic persistence starts. If another process
  owns the persistence lock, Tamework and dependent Animal Husbandry NPC assets still load while
  saved-state features remain safely unavailable.
- Generic persistence now waits through a short server-shutdown handoff before it rejects a held
  process lock. A lock error now identifies the active or legacy path and whether the owner is in
  the same process or another process.
- Fixed water buckets placing water above feed troughs instead of filling them. Tamework now starts
  its embedded asset patcher before the initial asset load, so bucket integration changes refresh
  when the server starts.
- Updated the embedded Patchwork runtime to 1.3.3. Its packaged telemetry descriptor now declares
  the Patchwork version and passive heartbeat capability, so player-ready discovery no longer logs
  that the shaded Patchwork descriptor is incomplete.
- Reduced world-tick work for companion needs by reusing parsed runtime settings instead of rebuilding
  the same damage and tick-policy objects for each companion check.
- Reduced interaction prompt work by reusing reload-aware food lists and role scopes, avoiding
  temporary selection objects, resolving combined inventories only when required, and skipping
  unchanged prompt-cache writes.
- Reduced command HUD world-tick work by reusing unchanged group status, sharing reticle target
  queries between the target and hotswap HUDs, and selecting bounded player batches.
- Reduced command HUD server work when many players are online.
- Large companion groups now spread due needs updates and cold food or water searches across world
  ticks. Nearby companions share cached resource results instead of repeating the same search.
- Command HUD cleanup now stays on the world thread and completes in order when players or stores
  unload. This prevents stale HUD state and unload races.
- Cache-first needs resource sensors can omit the duplicate need gate, so dependent NPC assets load
  without repeating the Hunger or Thirst condition.
- Projectile launch interactions now provide ballistic data to Hytale's NPC aiming logic, so ranged
  NPC attacks no longer fall back to close-combat aiming.

## 3.1.9 - Companion Spawn Safety Hotfix - 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- Newly spawned companion projections now clear stale fall distance and
  velocity and receive brief fall-damage protection. Bonded summons and NPCs
  released from capture items no longer die from invalid spawn-time falls.
- Bonded roster companions now start every summon at full health. Capturing or
  storing a badly injured companion can no longer make its next summon die at
  once.
- Normal capture items now reject NPCs that have already died or reached zero
  health. Injured living NPCs keep their captured health when released, so the
  item cannot be used as a free heal.
- `/tw debugdb` now writes its chat responses to the server log so support
  diagnostics remain available after the command output closes.
- `/tw debugrespawntrace` now covers bonded roster summons, including planned
  health, projection results, early world failures, immediate live state,
  first damage, and delayed health probes. Dead-target capture denials now log
  the target, role, item, health, and death-component state.

## 3.1.8 - Embedded Runtime Hotfix - 2026-08-15

### Fixed
- Updated the embedded Patchwork runtime to 1.3.2. Tamework now participates in
  Patchwork election as version 1.3.2 and packages the current compact runtime.

## 3.1.6 - Companion Performance Hotfix - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- Reduced companion load stalls. Role appearance data and optional model APIs
  are now cached, trait and progression repair share one load pass, and exact
  NPC identity lookups use an index.
- Reduced bonded companion database work. Expiry warnings now use committed
  runtime lease state, known-empty worlds skip recurring SQLite queries,
  capture-event recovery polls only while delivery is pending, and retention
  cleanup uses a slower one-minute cadence.
- Reduced mounted NPC tick work by limiting interactable safety and nameplate
  visibility scans to ten passes per second in each world.
- Reduced idle tranquilizer tracking work by checking loaded NPC effects once
  per second instead of ten times per second.
- Updated the embedded runtimes to Alec's Telemetry 1.2.1 and Patchwork 1.3.1.

## 3.1.5 - Interaction Performance and Persistence Hotfix - 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- Reduced world-thread stalls when NPC interaction actions are built. Prompt
  actions no longer create unused breeding and taming services, and active
  SimpleClaims capability lookups are reused safely until its plugin instance
  stops or is replaced.
- Reduced idle world-thread load from bonded companion maintenance. Recovery
  checks now use a slower fallback cadence, and loaded worlds share one bounded
  database maintenance pass instead of repeating it for every world.
- Concurrent companion checkpoints during world load no longer make a valid
  persistence database enter read-only mode. Capture, release, and exact NPC
  state checkpoints remain available after large groups of companions load.
- Capturing a retired original companion that reappears now waits for its
  exact-state identity reconciliation instead of treating it as a new NPC.
  This prevents duplicate companion identities and keeps the saved NPC state
  attached to the canonical companion.
- Flutes, treat bags, and other command items now repair older linked records
  that stored a retired NPC UUID as the profile ID. Recall redirects those
  records to the current companion instead of silently finding no target.

## 3.1.4 - Companion Persistence and Return Hotfix - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- `WORLD_TIME_SCALED` needs now preserve negative world timestamps, so hunger
  and thirst resume normally after storage or reload.
- Soul Collector releases now pause needs timers while companions are stored,
  and flute revival no longer restores lethal death health or needs state.
- Tamed companions now cancel a marker-driven despawn that was already
  pending when spawn authority was detached. This prevents nearby companions
  from disappearing even while their chunk and player remain loaded.
- Recall no longer treats a timeout or a missing live UUID as proof that an
  ordinary companion is Lost. This prevents partial, randomized replacements.
- Tamework now saves exact, integrity-checked companion entity checkpoints and
  restores the full serializable NPC state only after Hytale loads the exact
  source section and confirms that the saved body is absent.
- When a retired original companion returns after a generated replacement,
  Tamework now keeps the original full state, safely replaces the current
  command UUID, and removes the duplicate only after the restored entity is
  live. Conflicting duplicate evidence remains unchanged for manual review.

## 3.1.3 - Stale Active Recall Hotfix - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- Recall now repairs a missing companion whose command item reports Unloaded
  while canonical persistence still claims the exact NPC is active. Tamework
  first fences the exact alias, owner, and probed world to Unloaded, then runs
  a second normal Recall window before it can create a restorable Lost entry.
  This avoids replacing an NPC that loads late during recovery.

## 3.1.2 - NPC Recovery and Update 6 Hotfix - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- Prevented marker-owned tamed companions from losing their marker-side
  reference while the NPC is unloaded. This stops Hytale's lost-marker cleanup
  from deleting the NPC when its chunk loads later.
- Canonical command-roster entries now retain the world paired with their home
  coordinates, and Recall now loads the exact Update 6 entity section instead
  of only the horizontal chunk.
- An explicit Recall that exhausts every safe lookup can now convert an exact
  missing unloaded companion into a restorable Lost entry. Recovery preserves
  the durable profile, owner, role, name, tame state, home, and command links,
  then retires the missing alias before Respawn creates a replacement.
- Destructive removal during the NPC-load/startup-reconciliation race now
  captures the complete live state before the NPC is deleted.
- New imports from older public Tamework databases now resolve stale lifecycle
  flags from the one newest complete evidence set. Tied or incomplete evidence
  remains quarantined.
- Existing replacement databases now repair that same stale-flag quarantine in
  place when the original, unchanged public database matches the committed
  import fingerprint. No world or database rollback is required.
- Quarantined roster entries now show as unavailable instead of unloaded and
  no longer offer a Recall or Dismiss control that cannot succeed.

## 3.1.1 - NPC Startup Ordering Hotfix - 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- Fixed a startup ordering failure where Tamework could initialize before
  Hytale's NPC plugin had registered the NPC component type.
- Fixed floating mode-switch text disappearing after a captured companion was
  placed back into the world.

## 3.1.0 - Command Hotswaps, Spawn Controls, and Recovery - 2026-08-08

### Added
- Added a lower-right command-flute HUD with Link, Command Menu, and assignable
  Q/E/R hotswaps, including command-specific glyphs and active-group feedback.
- Added an assignable `Cycle Group` hotswap for generic command rosters.
- Added `/tw showspawnbeacons [radius|off]` to visualize nearby loaded natural
  spawn beacons without changing their spawning behavior.
- Added a purple-hatted scarecrow that uses native block placement and breaking,
  suppresses automatic spawn markers within 32 blocks, and applies native
  chunk-granular world-spawn suppression. Manual markers, explicit mod spawns,
  and existing NPCs remain unaffected.
- Added a shared attitude target that lets dependent mods make player-hostile
  creatures, including Void Grubs, retaliate against supported companions.

### Changed
- Updated the embedded Creditor library to 1.1.0 for improved version election
  and clearer credits-page tags.
- Locked grounded directional movement while charging an avatar-flight launch,
  while keeping mouse look and charge release available.

### Fixed
- Prevented runtime bonded-companion database failures from crashing worlds;
  bonded features now fail closed for the session and emit one privacy-safe
  telemetry diagnostic comparing startup and failure-time storage state.
- Fixed upgraded legacy scarecrow suppressors remaining active after the
  overlapping native scarecrow block was broken.
- Fixed command-hotswap assignment, input, selection hitboxes, group cycling,
  glyph alignment, and persistence, and prevented the linked-companion panel
  from overlapping the command radial at smaller screen widths.
- Fixed spawn-beacon visualization lifecycle issues, including hidden proxies
  in Adventure mode and late publication after a world or session was removed.
- Fixed recovery of stranded public-migration captures, including item-only
  histories and removed-world tombstones, without rerunning the migration.
- Fixed embedded telemetry UI assets not being exposed from the merged runtime
  and delayed companion-expiry effects so warnings begin at the intended time.

## 3.0.2 - Linked Patchwork Asset-Pack Hotfix - Unreleased

### Added
- Added a shared attitude target for tamed companions, letting dependent mods
  opt their companion groups into retaliation from player-hostile creatures
  without replacing base-game attitude assets.
- Added reusable autonomous-aerial Hold, favorite-item follow, and native
  airborne-mode transition components for downstream companion mods.
- Added reusable large-ground and autonomous-flying NPC follow components so
  downstream mods can share one implementation while overriding species tuning.
- Shared flying followers inherit `TameworkFlyingOrbit` obstacle avoidance and
  return-to-range improvements without copying the instruction component.
- Flying-follow teleport recovery now chooses a clear position beside the owner
  instead of overlapping the owner's occupied position.
- Added a replacement persistence system built around one canonical companion
  profile, stable identity aliases, durable lifecycle state, idempotent
  operations, crash recovery, and ordered projections.
- Added an immutable import path for public schema v2-v4 databases and the
  released DAT companion bundle. Source files are left untouched; tester-only
  schema v5-v9 databases are refused instead of being modified or merged.
- Added durable owner-population limits, role-based population groups, and
  command-family rosters that remain consistent across capture, release, death,
  storage, world travel, and server restarts.
- Added data-driven timed companion summoning and storage with per-role
  durations, expiry warnings, logout policy, resummon cooldowns, and safe rider
  dismount protection when a summon expires.
- Added configurable model effects for bonded-companion expiry warnings so
  downstream mods can visibly signal that a timed summon is about to end.
- Added idempotent dormant companion provisioning and activation for
  integrations such as HyDragon's bonded Miniwyvern.
- Added exact multi-item paid revival for Dead and Lost command companions,
  including pre-charge admission, operation-specific escrow, crash recovery,
  and exact refunds when a terminal failure is proven.
- Added `TwCapturePolicyConfig` and opt-in probabilistic capture through
  `TwSpawnerConfig.ChanceMode: Probability`. Capture attempts resolve and
  consume their configured source exactly once, support in-place tame-and-link
  workflows, and report specific denial or success reasons.
- Added channeled wild capture with configurable channel audio/effects, Dragon
  Stone burst visuals, and capped homing visual projectiles that can also be
  launched through a reusable interaction extension.
- Added restart-safe bonded capture completion evidence for integrations,
  including owner, roster, source-NPC, and live-notification details.
- Added direct captured-item intake for configured coops so the same canonical
  companion can enter a coop without an intermediate live spawn.
- Added a capability-gated profile-data API with versioned reads,
  revision-fenced idempotent compare-and-set, and restart-visible operation
  lookup while retaining the legacy profile-data API for compatibility.
- Restored `/tw debugdb export` with a bounded, redacted support ZIP containing
  operational status and durable diagnostic summaries without copying player
  identities, coordinates, inventories, world saves, or the database itself.
- Added a one-time 3.0 persistence-rework announcement with instructions for
  collecting `/tw debugdb export` support data and reporting issues.
- Added a config-gated `To Me` control for shoulder-riding companions. Role
  assets define standing and crouching offsets; mounted companions track the
  owner's pose, idle naturally, suspend AI, collision, and interaction, and
  remain invulnerable until set down.
- Added `TwCompanionMovementConfig` so species, equipment, traits, levels, and
  talents can modify travel speed on foot and while natively ridden.
- Added configurable XP for actively summoned companions and the
  `TameworkHasTalent` NPC sensor for talent-aware role behavior.
- Embedded Patchwork 1.2.1 as Tamework's non-destructive JSON asset-patch
  runtime, including version-first runtime election, Tamework macros,
  composable conditions, and registered mod-data JSON sources.
- Updated the embedded Patchwork runtime to 1.2.2 so linked development asset
  packs are discovered and patched normally.
- Added `TwDynamicAttachmentsConfig` for permanent or reversible,
  while-matching NPC attachment changes based on role, name, needs, happiness,
  traits, life stage, gender, tame/owner state, and percentage thresholds.
- Added atomic built-in interaction extensions for mapped attachment equipment,
  replacement, and empty-hand removal, including inventory/model/persistence
  rollback without per-item Java handlers.
- Added `ChangeAppearance` to interaction `SetRole` effects so an asset can
  choose whether a role change also updates the NPC's visible appearance.
- Added `TwBreedingConfig.Inheritance.AttachmentInheritance.ExcludedSets` so
  equipment and other non-genetic attachment sets can be excluded from
  offspring inheritance.
- Added `/tw debug set` and `/tw debug get` groups for needs and breeding
  tuning with Hytale's standard world, entity, cone, ray, sphere, range, role,
  and nearest selectors.
- Added Accurate, Auto Fast, and Always Fast needs-resource modes under
  `/tw settings` so crowded servers can bypass expensive food and water path
  checks when appropriate.
- Added asset-configured transformed-player Avatar Flight. Tamed mounts can
  transform their rider, hide and preserve the original companion, and restore
  both safely on manual dismount, disconnect, crash recovery, or restart.
- Added the Flightmaster's Talisman with configurable upward flaps, directional
  boosts, airbraking, crouch descent, pitch-based glide, native ground speed,
  camera/eye-height overrides, and per-species movement tuning.
- Added Avatar Flight Vigour, charged crouch launches, separate cruise/glide
  caps, a compact speed/pitch/charge HUD, control hints, and configurable
  per-slot combat abilities with glyphs and live cooldown countdowns.
- Added bounded Avatar Flight XP for qualified fast-flight time, plus six
  purchasable talent effects for Vigour, boost, glide, climb, and flight-speed
  tuning.
- Added configurable Avatar Flight launch/boost particles, positional and
  looping audio, one-shot animation hooks, fast-flight state, and model trails.
- Added an Avatar Flight asset namespace generator for rider-safe model and
  animation variants with a dedicated `AF_Origin` pose root.
- Added `TameworkConfirmLanding` so large or pitched flying NPCs can confirm
  physical touchdown instead of relying only on the base `Land` goal.
- Added `TameworkFlyingOrbit`, a configurable flying body motion with cycle,
  orbit, approach, face-target, target-relative wandering, and pass-through
  modes for aerial combat and ambient behavior.
- Added explicit player-model and Avatar Flight input/client-flight probes for
  isolated model, control, and movement diagnostics.
- Added Draconic Altar recipes for enabled tranquilizer equipment.
- Added a private-server licensing template for negotiated custom plugins,
  private forks, and server-specific adaptations.

### Changed
- Companion capture/release, configured-coop capture/release, death/Lost
  restoration, profile extensions, population, rosters, timed summons,
  provisioning, and revival now share one persistence lifecycle and operation
  authority instead of feature-specific journals and caches.
- Dead or Lost state now requires positive saved-death, destructive-removal, or
  delete-on-remove-world evidence. Ordinary unloads, absence, and timeouts no
  longer reclassify companions.
- Managed companion identity now follows one stable profile across entity UUID
  changes, allowing command items, coops, and recovery paths to resolve
  historical aliases without duplicating an NPC.
- Automatic companion following across login, portals, and world changes is
  disabled by default. Explicit Follow remains local and explicit cross-world
  Recall remains available.
- Bonded and normal linked panels now refresh live health, needs, progression,
  revival, countdown, and flight-mode state without repeatedly rebuilding the
  page. Configured companions can switch between ground and flight modes from
  either panel; bonded cards also show XP progress, level/talent bonuses, and
  retain the correct role-specific talent tree.
- Bonded companion talents can now modify finite summon duration and resummon
  cooldown in addition to their progression and movement effects.
- Bonded summon expiry now has a configurable warning schedule and protects
  riders from unsafe dismounts while the companion is being stored.
- Autonomous flying companions now probe their actual movement corridor before
  committing to a route, steer around nearby trees and structures, and return
  toward their owner or combat target when they drift beyond their configured
  wander range.
- Refreshed the command radial artwork and layout, including a correctly placed
  close button and consistent linked-panel controls.
- Deepened the built-in bear roar audio so configured bear interactions carry
  a fuller low-frequency layer.
- Moved bundled patch definitions to `Server/Patchwork/Patches`. The legacy
  `Server/Tamework/Patches` root remains readable while Tamework is installed,
  with neutral definitions taking precedence on conflicts.
- Replaced `/tw patches` with `/patchwork status`, `/patchwork reload`, and
  `/patchwork selftest`. Regeneration reports restart-required when live
  activation is unavailable.
- Removed runtime asset-pack reordering and legacy pack replacement so asset
  precedence follows Hytale manifest load order.
- SimpleClaims companion protection now follows its native full-world, admin,
  member-permission, player-ally, party-ally, and outsider rules. Owner and
  population-group caps use durable reservations while breeding limits continue
  to use direct claim counts.
- Replaced `/tw npcspawntamed <role> <quantity>` with
  `/tw spawntamed <role>`, live role completion, and optional `--count`,
  `--radius`, and `--attachment` switches.
- `/tw debugplayermodel` now requires the explicit `unsafe` argument.
- Migrated the project build and release packaging from Maven to the shared
  Gradle build, including configuration-cache support.
- Updated Alec's Tamework from GPL-3.0 to the Alec's Tamework Source Available
  License 1.0. Unmodified dependency use and example/template reuse remain
  allowed; forks, modified copies, and reuse of Tamework systems require
  separate written permission.

### Fixed
- Fixed tranquilized creatures leaving their sleep animation when struck by a
  zero-damage tranquilizer arrow. Tranquilized dragons and Animal Husbandry
  predators now remain visibly asleep through repeat tranquilizer hits.
- Fixed the bonded-roster flight/ground button intermittently ignoring clicks
  after live health, level, XP, or other card updates.
- Fixed settings announcements replaying after every Tamework update; they now
  reappear only when a player has not seen the current announcement.
- Fixed fully charged Avatar Flight launches sometimes being replaced by a
  tiny second charge before the movement tick applied the launch.
- Fixed Avatar Flight ending midair during longer flights by keeping the hidden
  parked companion attached to its rider instead of leaving it in the takeoff chunk.
- Fixed Avatar Flight sometimes moving a companion back to its takeoff location
  during or shortly after a normal dismount. Mid-air F-key dismount now restores
  the companion at the current flight position.
- Fixed Avatar Flight's temporary parking role replacing a companion's real
  species, display name, or tamed state in Beast Flute persistence.
- Fixed shared flying components using computed values for Hytale fields that
  only accept literals, which caused downstream flying NPC roles to fail
  validation.
- Fixed public v2.16.1 captured companions and filled spawners failing to
  restore after import, including records without an optional tamed-state field.
- Fixed imported worlds remaining read-only when companions continued loading
  during startup reconciliation; mutation readiness now retries from sealed
  live-world evidence.
- Fixed mixed-case role IDs and interaction role swaps being lost across timed
  storage, capture, restart, or Avatar Flight parking states.
- Fixed stale companion locations and changed live UUIDs blocking capture,
  configured-coop intake, release, Recall, or command-roster operations.
- Fixed cross-world Recall inserting before destination chunks were retained,
  redraining completed sources, or allowing saved source chunks to resurrect a
  duplicate. Each request now retains its exact source/destination evidence and
  coalesces equivalent retries.
- Fixed generated-instance deletion, delete-on-remove worlds, and verified
  destructive cleanup leaving linked companions permanently unreachable.
  Complete terminal snapshots can now author Lost recovery without treating
  ordinary unloads as death.
- Fixed login and portal transitions recalling companions from stale Follow
  state. Hold, Return Home, and Recall now publish their current command state
  before later travel decisions.
- Fixed linked-panel actions resolving the player's old world after a portal or
  instance transition, and prevented one damaged link from blocking other valid
  companions on the same command item.
- Fixed unloaded linked cards losing custom names, capture state, revive
  cooldowns, or role-configured revival costs.
- Fixed captured-item names treating generic role IDs as custom names, and
  added clear required-status warnings plus success sounds and particles only
  after durable capture/release publication.
- Fixed coop intake and release across UUID alias changes, deterministic release
  placement, and recall of companions previously released from a coop.
- Fixed growing captured offspring changing sex-specific or variant roles when
  released; life-stage role lineage now round-trips with the companion.
- Fixed `/tw setbreedingready true` and the equivalent API call leaving
  Hytale's breeding alarm active, and fixed breeding/cooldown logic treating
  valid negative Hytale world timestamps as unset.
- Fixed temporary SQLite locks permanently disabling later persistence writes.
  Operations still fail safely after bounded retries and recover once the lock
  clears.
- Fixed a confirmed rolled-back persistence operation disabling all later
  capture, release, coop, Recall, and companion-state writes.
- Fixed tamed companions remaining owned by their original Hytale spawn marker
  or beacon, which could unload and restore them after players left the area.
  Existing companions and markers now repair both sides of that relationship,
  even when the other entity is not loaded at the same time.
- Prevented overlapping queued breedings from reusing the same parent and now
  rechecks nearby population limits when each delayed litter is born, containing
  rare animal floods after leaving and returning to an area.
- Delayed births now refresh both parents' ownership before spawning. Pairings
  configured to require one owner are canceled if ownership changed, rather
  than giving offspring a stale or scan-order-dependent owner.
- Fixed automatic Hytale backups failing on Windows while persistence was
  active by moving process locks to Hytale's backup-excluded `LOCK` layout.
- Removed a false packaged-server SLF4J binder `SEVERE` warning when opening
  Tamework's SQLite store.
- Fixed permanent or non-revivable companion deaths being quarantined, corrupting
  corpse-removal state, or remaining stuck when no death cause was resolvable.
- Fixed `SetOwner` accepting missing or malformed UUIDs, and aligned runtime
  and Public API damage decisions on the same live-owner precedence and
  role-resolved protection settings.
- Fixed prefab saving unregistering the generated asset-patch pack and removing
  patched interactions until restart.
- Fixed large or pitched flying NPCs remaining on their Fly controller after
  collision had already reached the ground.
- Fixed transformed Avatar Flight lifecycle cleanup, swimming handoff, movement
  input projection, equipment restoration, HUD reuse, rider/model isolation,
  animation state, and speed clamping so the final configured flight path no
  longer carries the unreleased prototype's crash-prone native-rider behavior.
- Fixed timed companions and Avatar Flight forms losing attachment selections,
  talent state, expiry effects, or their parked companion during role changes,
  logout, teardown recovery, and protected dismounts.
- Fixed successful or retired capture attempts being reconsidered by later
  systems, and restored the owner's follow target after summoning a companion.

## 2.16.1 - Server Stability Hotfix - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- Reworked experimental NordicDrake mounted glide to use Hytale's native NPC mount flow and rider velocity, with native grounded walking, jump-to-launch flight, and pitch-based glide behavior.
- Fixed mounted glide ground handling so NordicDrakes no longer force forward glide before flight is active.
- Fixed mounted glide launch detection so missing mount ground-state data no longer starts flight just because the rider is attached above ground at the mount anchor.
- Fixed mounted glide landing detection so NordicDrakes return to grounded mode when the mount lands, even if the rider anchor still appears airborne.
- Fixed mounted glide flap input so a single mounted jump press queues one cooldown-limited upward boost instead of repeating indefinitely when native packets keep reporting jump as held.
- Fixed mounted glide flap direction so normal forward movement no longer converts jump flaps into forward boosts; only sprint does.
- Fixed mounted glide motion cleanup so the experimental flight controller no longer keeps driving NordicDrakes after flight is inactive or the rider has dismounted.
- Fixed mounted glide dismount cleanup so glide mounts remove native mount state, restore Tamework NPC state, and return the interaction prompt cleanly.
- Fixed mounted glide remounting after dismount by restoring the NPC's original native role instead of leaving it in the temporary mounted role.
- Fixed managed coop scans so optional block-state reflection misses are cached instead of throwing repeatedly on the world tick thread, and reduced stale-ref noise while resolving coop block locations.
- Fixed several server-freeze risks in high-activity worlds by keeping Tamework ticking-system sweep and cache state scoped to each active world store instead of sharing it across instances.
- Moved legacy telemetry migration and compatibility metrics work onto dedicated daemon workers with HTTP timeouts, reducing startup and tick stalls when telemetry or metrics I/O is slow.
- Fixed NPC profile persistence updates so partial state saves merge with existing profile data instead of clearing unrelated fields during revive, recall, and lost-recovery flows.
- Fixed captured spawner edge cases so stacked spawner items cannot be capture targets, and failed spawn attempts roll back item consumption.
- Fixed interaction inventory effects so full inventory or hand failures fail closed instead of partially applying incomplete item changes.
- Fixed command selection UI refresh and navigation callbacks so delayed updates ignore unloaded worlds instead of throwing during unload races.
- Fixed a rare command target HUD crash that could happen when inventory or hotbar events updated player candidates while the world tick was snapshotting them.
- Fixed command target HUD tame requirements showing one required tranquilizer stack even when the NPC role required more.

## 2.16.0 - Command Target HUD and Needs Performance - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- Updated the embedded Alec's Telemetry runtime to 1.0.1.
- Feed trough water states now require holding the empty interaction briefly, reducing accidental water dumps from quick use-key taps.
- Empty feed trough prompts now mention that right-clicking with a water bucket fills the trough.
- Linked companion panel cards now show active harvest cooldown timers beside breeding cooldown timers.
- Linked companion panel cooldown timers now use icon art for breeding and harvest instead of letter labels.
- Linked companion panel cards now show an attempting-recall countdown before an unloaded companion is marked lost.
- Linked companion recall now marks an unreachable NPC lost after 10 seconds by default.
- Taming now tells players when a new companion is automatically linked to a command item, or when no matching command item was found in inventory.
- Taming now shows warning notifications when the player is at the per-player ownership limit or the target claim is at its SimpleClaims companion limit.
- Holding a command item while looking at a supported NPC within 15 units now shows a compact right-side status HUD with vitals, progression details, food profiles, attachment selections, owner display, and tame tranquilizer requirements when available.
- Command target HUD vitals, cooldowns, level, talent points, gender, and traits now use the same compact ring controls and header placement as the linked companion panel.
- Added `TwFoodConfig` assets for role food profiles with Preferred, Premium, Compatible, and Disliked categories shared by taming prompts, feed matching, needs consumption, happiness deltas, and the command target HUD.
- Reduced companion needs search overhead in busy worlds by sharing scan caches, staggering sweeps, backing off absent resources, and consuming from already-resolved food or water targets first.

### Fixed
- Fixed feed trough water clearing so releasing the use key before the hold finishes cancels emptying, instead of dumping water after a quick tap.
- Fixed the companion needs and happiness runtime settings so disabling them fully stops the affected behavior instead of leaving partial updates active.
- Fixed captured spawner ownership checks so spawners that clear ownership on capture can be traded and spawned by the receiving player.
- Role-specific companion genders now override incompatible stored gender values so configured roles such as deer doe/stag cannot keep the wrong gender after capture, respawn, or taming.
- Command target HUD food display now resolves role food profiles before legacy role params, so favorite foods can be shown separately from compatible feed items such as feedbags or cohort feed.
- Command target HUD food and tame requirement rows now render food items through item-slot icons and show tranquilizer stack requirements more reliably.
- Command target HUD attachment selections now use the same `Name: Value` line format as captured spawner item tooltips.
- Command target HUD now clears and refreshes nearly instantly when players stop targeting a supported NPC, switch held items, or look at another supported NPC.
- Command target HUD now appears for untamed NPCs that have enabled Tamework tame interactions.
- Command target HUD now uses hotbar slot and inventory change events plus slower same-target status refreshes to reduce server work without delaying target switching or hide behavior.
- Fixed linked companion breeding toggles disappearing after some revive, recall, or lost-recovery flows when breeding was available but cooldown state was unavailable.
- Fixed revived and lost-recovered companions sometimes missing progression state such as happiness, needs, levels, traits, or talents.

## 2.15.5 - Embedded Consent Funnel Hotfix - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- Updated the embedded Alec's Telemetry runtime to 0.2.5.

## 2.15.4 - Server Verification Setup Hotfix - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- Updated the embedded Alec's Telemetry runtime to 0.2.4.
- Server owners can now run `/telemetry server verify <key>` to save the ModStats server claim token and verify immediately instead of editing the identity file by hand.

### Fixed
- The embedded telemetry runtime now migrates old save-folder, server-root, and
  embedded-owner telemetry data into `mods/Alechilles_Alec's Telemetry!` and
  removes stale legacy files after successful migration.
- The embedded telemetry runtime now leaves unsupported telemetry categories
  undefined in project consent overrides, so future Tamework or downstream
  telemetry defaults are not pinned off by older local settings.

## 2.15.3 - Telemetry Intake Backoff Hotfix - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- Updated the embedded Alec's Telemetry runtime to 0.2.3.

### Fixed
- Honored hosted telemetry intake backoff hints so Tamework slows retry attempts when the hosted ingest service is under pressure.
- Fixed low-needs thought bubble textures so food and water icons render at the intended 160px size.

## 2.15.2 - Aggregate ModStats Heartbeat Hotfix - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Updated the embedded Alec's Telemetry runtime to 0.2.2.
- Reduced ModStats upload pressure by using the new aggregate stats heartbeat runtime, so multiple installed telemetry-enabled mods no longer require one separate heartbeat upload each from the active Tamework runtime.

## 2.15.1 - Coop World Thread Freeze Fix and Other Stability Fixes - 2026-06-19

### Changed
- Updated the embedded Alec's Telemetry runtime to 0.2.1.

### Fixed
- Fixed a server freeze that could happen when coop-resident NPCs unloaded with chunks, especially in animal-heavy worlds.
- Fixed companion needs so animals do not apply days of unloaded hunger or thirst decay in one update when they load again.
- Fixed linked companion recovery snapshots so captured gender is preserved through death, lost-state recovery, and respawn flows.

## 2.15.0 - Telemetry Reports and Runtime Cleanup - 2026-06-18

### Added
- Added telemetry-backed manual player reports so Tamework can collect issue and suggestion submissions with attachment and resolution-update support.
- Added opt-in telemetry stats descriptors plus a packaged consent icon so embedded telemetry surfaces can present project-specific consent and reporting metadata.

### Changed
- Routed embedded telemetry through the shared runtime host and removed the old runtime-mode descriptor dependency for the bundled Tamework project descriptor.
- Replaced `/tw settings` telemetry controls with guidance that sends players to `/telemetry consent`.

### Fixed
- Fixed telemetry enablement defaults so consent review and stats remain independently controllable when Tamework owns the active runtime.
- Fixed live role display names to resolve against the current role state.
- Fixed optimized interaction `RoleParam` resolution so authored role `Parameters` can override literal tame and `SetRole` targets without requiring duplicate exported role fields.

## 2.14.1 - Companion Needs Pathing Fixes - 2026-06-16

### Added
- Added HStats forwarding for Celly's Baby Animals and Celly's Wildlife Skins when Tamework detects those installed mods.

### Changed
- Added reusable NPC position-target rejection and a generic reachable block target sensor/action so downstream animal behaviors can preflight block-seeking destinations before entering movement.
- Reused needs target search results during food and water checks so companion scans avoid repeating the same expensive lookups while still refreshing when an NPC moves or a target changes.
- Added adaptive runtime pressure backoff plus depleted-water and source-miss throttles so crowded worlds spend less time repeatedly probing unavailable needs targets.
- Improved companion food and water seeking so NPCs use bounded motion-controller projection to choose reachable trough and water stand targets, including diagonal approach positions, while keeping existing needs search caching and consume behavior.
- Adjusted needs-seek movement so custom preflight owns food and water reachability while vanilla seek stays pathfinder-first until consume range, reducing cases where companions accept a resource target but stand still.
- Needs seek now respects failed-seek cooldowns before re-entering movement, can re-scan from resting Hold states, and temporarily skips failed targets so blocked food or water sources do not trap companions in Idle/NeedsSeek loops.
- Needs resource scans now run a bounded pathfinder preflight before entering movement, so blocked troughs or water sources no longer pull companions out of idle/resting states unless a path is already confirmed.
- Needs resource preflight now treats a path near the selected food or water stand target as sufficient and leaves exact final approach recovery to movement stall handling, improving consistency around crowded resources.
- Needs resource seek now targets the food or water source itself and validates movement by consume-radius approach distance instead of requiring a projected adjacent stand point, improving crowded trough consistency.
- Needs resource movement now keeps vanilla seek after preflight while enabling simple steering fallback to compare crowded food and water movement behavior.
- Feed trough blocks are now added to the vanilla Fence block set through an asset patch so movement and path checks treat trough variants consistently with fence-like obstacles.
- Replaced the telemetry toggles in `/tw settings` with guidance to manage telemetry consent through `/telemetry consent`.

### Fixed
- Fixed captured spawner items so companion gender is preserved even when capture happens before explicit life-stage gender metadata has been written.
- Fixed companion needs consumption so animals can remain at reachable food or water and consume repeatedly until the relevant need rises above the seek threshold, instead of returning to idle after one bite or drink.
- Fixed repeated needs consumption so completed food and water visits release their reserved approach point immediately, reducing avoidable delays for other nearby animals.
- Fixed companion needs-seek movement so food and water trips with no useful movement progress reject the current target after a short grace period instead of standing in NeedsSeek until the long timeout.
- Fixed companion needs seeking so a temporary source lookup miss is not reused after the NPC moves to a different block, reducing cases where starving or thirsty companions fail to retry nearby food or water sources.
- Fixed companion needs stand selection so a failed path candidate does not make NPCs ignore other reachable approach points around the same food or water source.
- Fixed water seeking so companions can retry a recently confirmed water target after wandering just outside the normal source scan radius, without expanding the routine block scan.
- Reduced the sensor-side no-path memory for needs resource checks so temporary water path preflight misses do not suppress valid retries for half a minute.
- Fixed needs-seek planning so a valid water target is not overwritten by a food target in the same sensor pass when both hunger and thirst are low.
- Reduced repeated companion needs-seek retries by giving confirmed food and water paths a longer movement window and a faster seek pace before timing out.
- Fixed companion needs-seek priority so hunger can interrupt water top-offs when food is the lower need, while keeping fallback behavior when the preferred resource is unavailable.
- Improved companion needs-seek fairness so food gets priority when hunger and thirst are nearly tied, reducing long water-biased delays at mid-range needs.
- Fixed companion needs-seek movement so aborted paths and sustained blocked nav states reject the current food or water target before the full move timeout, reducing long stalls around crowded resources.
- Fixed companion needs-seek targeting so multiple NPCs do not pile onto the same confirmed food or water approach point, and water targets avoid standing on the source block itself.
- Fixed companion needs-seek movement so an active food or water trip keeps the target it started with instead of following later planner updates mid-path.
- Fixed active needs-seek scans so animals can detect reachable food and water on nearby vertical terrain without widening passive refill sweeps.
- Fixed reachable block target scans so block-set checks use the resolved block-set index instead of relying on repeated engine exceptions during failed food and water searches.

## 2.14.0 - Localization and Runtime Polish - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Added language-key support for Tamework talent, trait, command, settings, progression, interaction, and happiness UI text so translations can be provided through `Server/Languages/*/server.lang`.
- Added bundled French (France), French (Canada), and Brazilian Portuguese `server.lang` translations for Tamework UI, item, config, and notification text.

### Changed
- Reduced needs water target scanning churn so companion water searches resolve candidate item IDs and refill container checks more narrowly.

### Fixed
- Fixed ridden flying mounts so collision recovery clears blocked motion and prevents mounts from getting stuck after hitting terrain.
- Fixed Java-built Tamework UI text, including companion talent effect rows and settings pages, so non-English `server.lang` fallbacks use the player's language instead of bundled English.
- Fixed asset patches so archived mods such as DynamicSeasons can be used as the source asset for generated patched bucket assets.

## 2.13.3 - Harvest Timer and Asset Pack Hotfix - 2026-06-07

### Added
- Added a 256x256 in-game icon for the Tamework asset pack.
- Embedded Creditor so `/credits` is available from the Tamework jar and includes richer Tamework credit metadata.
- Added a generic `TameworkAlarm` NPC sensor so assets can listen for durable Tamework alarm states without relying on base-game alarms.
- Added `debugride`-gated mounted ride input diagnostics for tracing rider packet and fallback movement intent.

### Changed
- Moved feed-trough water refill bucket integration from full bucket item overrides into targeted asset patches, improving compatibility with other mods that edit bucket assets.

### Fixed
- Fixed progression-scaled harvest cooldowns so milk and other harvestable animal interactions use vanilla-style world-time durations, honor temporal `HarvestTimeout` values like `P1D`, and recover animals already stuck with legacy wall-clock cooldowns.
- Fixed harvest cooldown setup so optimized milk and container harvest interactions resolve the animal's configured `HarvestTimeout`, refuse to overwrite an active harvest cooldown, reject missing or zero-length harvest timers, and apply the cooldown gate before handing out milk or other harvest rewards.
- Fixed optimized milk and container harvests so their cooldown survives harvest state transitions and prevents repeated immediate milking until the configured world-time cooldown expires.
- Fixed milk and container harvest bonus procs so `CooldownPreserve` resolves role-specific `HarvestBonusMode` settings before deciding whether to skip the harvest cooldown.

## 2.13.2 - Companion Instant-Death and Diagnostics Fixes - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Added `/tw debugrespawntrace` to log linked companion revive and lost-recovery spawn, restore, damage, and death-removal correlation for instant-death investigations.
- Added `/tw debugneedstelemetry` to control rate-limited Alec's Telemetry context events for needs seek and consume failures.

### Changed
- Updated the embedded Alec's Telemetry runtime to `0.1.3`.
- Expanded Alec's Telemetry context for linked companion respawn, persistence, UI page, and config reload/apply failures.

### Fixed
- Protected revived and lost-recovered linked companions from invalid spawn-time fall damage so they no longer instantly die after replacement spawning.
- Protected breeding offspring from invalid spawn-time fall damage so newborn companions no longer instantly die after spawning.

## 2.13.1 - Native Spawner Tooltips and Runtime Cache Fixes - 2026-06-04

### Changed
- Captured spawner tooltip text now uses Hytale's built-in item display metadata instead of an optional tooltip bridge.

### Fixed
- Fixed generated asset patch pack ordering so patch overlays load after the source pack they target.
- Stabilized generated asset patch publication so repeated regeneration preserves pack ordering and avoids stale patch-pack placement.
- Cached optional integration reflection fallbacks so missing SimpleClaims, feed-trough container APIs, and legacy combat-text protocol paths no longer rebuild missing-class exceptions in repeated runtime flows.
- Fixed a multi-world attachment sync crash caused by fail-fast shared cache pruning on concurrent world ticks.

## 2.13.0 - Conditional Asset Patches and Settings Cleanup - 2026-06-03

### Added
- Added multi-target and expanded conditional optional asset patches so integration authors can apply the same patch to several assets and gate patches on installed mods, target/asset presence, mod/game versions, JSON paths, and `/tw settings` values.

### Changed
- Updated settings-owned Tamework config fields so runtime behavior follows `/tw settings` first while preserving defaults for older worlds and existing assets.
- Reduced repeated prompt planning, needs resource scans, attachment sync sweeps, and nameplate trait segment churn in common companion flows.

### Fixed
- Fixed generated Tamework config overlay reloads so `/tw patches reload` and hot reloads refresh generated config patches consistently.
- Fixed settings cleanup runtime overrides so spawners, happiness, breeding, ownership, needs, progression, revive, travel, and telemetry checks honor the resolved `/tw settings` values.

## 2.12.2 - Simplified Preset Hotfix - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- Updated Modtale release metadata to target Hytale `0.5.3`.
- Updated the simplified Minecraft-like settings preset to turn companion genders off by default.

### Fixed
- Fixed Hytale `0.5.3` setup crashes when Hytale reports a player-event registry as already shut down during startup; affected optional listeners now warn and Tamework continues loading.
- Fixed simplified Minecraft-like settings leaving juvenile lifecycle roles without growth state, preventing baby animals from growing into breedable adults.

## 2.12.1 - SQLite Startup Hotfix - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- Fixed Hytale `0.5.3` setup crashes caused by SQLite JDBC seeing another mod's SLF4J classes first, keeping persistence driver failures recoverable instead of setup-fatal.

## 2.12.0 - Companion Talent Trees and Progression Utilities - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Added a scrollable branch/tier companion talent tree UI with prerequisite connectors, selected-node detail panels, horizontal panning for wide trees, dynamic panel sizing, and centered pan controls that adapt to the active tree width.
- Added companion talent reset support so purchased talents can be refunded and re-spent while the companion is loaded.
- Added progression modifier breakdowns for linked-panel tooltips so level, talent, and trait effects are easier to inspect.
- Added `/tw setlevel <level>` to set the companion level for the NPC in front of the player, intended for testing and balance verification.
- Added a linked-panel group selector that can show all linked companions, no linked companions, or one configured command group.
- Added utility talent effect support for needs decay, revive cooldown, trait mutation chance, appearance mutation chance, harvest cooldown, happiness gain, breed cooldown, and fertility.
- Added `TameworkHarvestAlarm` so harvest-ready timers can be scaled by progression effects instead of hard-coded raw alarm durations.
- Added generic durable `TameworkAlarm` state for harvest cooldowns, with configurable `HarvestCooldownMultiplierEffectKey` support for choosing which progression effect scales harvest timing.
- Added harvest-luck cooldown preservation support for container-style harvests, such as filling a bucket, so luck can avoid consuming the harvest cooldown without duplicating containers.
- Added `Feed.AwardCooldownSeconds` to `TwLevelingConfig` and per-companion feed XP cooldown state so repeated feed interactions cannot spam XP.
- Added `/tw settings` toggles for the alpha companion leveling and talents systems, enabled by default for existing worlds.

### Changed
- Updated progression tooltips and linked-panel layout to fit the expanded level, XP, talent, trait, and modifier information.
- Updated example mobs and config documentation to exercise the newer progression and talent utility hooks.
- Moved the linked companion count into the panel header and replaced the subtitle count row with the group selector.

### Fixed
- Fixed `/tw settings` and `/tw news` permission checks so OPs/admins are evaluated through the live `PlayerRef` permission holder instead of the player component after Hytale Update 5.
- Fixed compatibility with summoned mounts from other mods by preserving valid mount owner references until vanilla mount setup finishes.

## 2.11.5 - Companion XP Events and Persistence Path Fixes - 2026-05-28

### Added
- Added public alpha companion XP award events through `TameworkApi.events()` so external mods can subscribe and credit owner-facing skills from successful companion XP activity.
- Added `/tw debugxpevents [on|off]` to subscribe to Tamework's own public companion XP events and log event hits for in-game verification, with extra harvest-drop diagnostics for XP attempts that are rejected before an API event is emitted.

### Changed
- Updated the embedded Alec's Telemetry runtime to `0.1.2`.

### Fixed
- Fixed state-driven `TameworkHarvestDrop` harvest flows so successful harvest drops award companion harvest XP and emit companion XP events.
- Fixed companion XP awards so unlinked tamed or owned companions can gain XP and emit XP events; command links now only provide optional event tool-id context.
- Fixed Tamework data directory discovery so startup and migrations stay anchored to the active server/userdata layout instead of drifting into unrelated temp `universe` folders.

## 2.11.4 - Alpha Companion Progression and Server Version Metadata - 2026-05-27

### Added
- Added alpha companion XP and talent systems for Tamework example mobs. These systems are available for early testing and may change before they are treated as stable.

### Changed
- Carried forward the corrected Hytale `0.5.x` target server version metadata so the release is not pinned to a single `0.5` patch version.
- Reworked the linked companion panel progression UI to show level and XP in the compact progress circle, with spendable talent points shown as a talent button only when points are available.

### Fixed
- Fixed automatic food, storage water, and natural water consumption so eligible linked companions gain progression XP from the same survival flows as manual feeding.
- Fixed talent page navigation and stale linked-panel refresh commands that could disconnect players when opening, closing, or reopening the talents menu.

## 2.11.3 - Hytale 0.5.1 Command Registration Hotfix - 2026-05-26

### Added
- Added a first-run "Welcome to Alec's Tamework" settings announcement with a Review Settings button so new eligible players see setup guidance instead of an old version-specific update notice.
- Added bundled alpha example leveling and talent configs so the Tamework example mobs can gain XP, level up, and exercise the talent page out of the box.

### Changed
- Updated release metadata for Hytale `0.5.1`.
- Settings announcements now use per-player Tamework version history: first-time users see the welcome message, while version-specific notices appear only after that player has used an older Tamework version.
- The local build now references a stable shared NameplateBuilder jar copy under the Hytale Modding directory instead of depending on whichever server mods folder is active.
- Replaced the alpha linked companion XP and talent point rows with a compact level progress ring and spendable talent point button.

### Fixed
- Fixed the Hytale `0.5.x` manifest version range so the packaged `2.11.3` jar loads on compatible `0.5` patch releases instead of being rejected while an older jar remains active.
- Fixed `/tw` failing to register on Hytale `0.5.1` servers because stricter permission validation rejected the display-name-derived permission node, restoring startup for affected servers.
- Fixed combat XP writes so damage-system leveling updates route through `CommandBuffer` instead of mutating the entity store directly during damage event handling.
- Fixed linked companion cards clipping the new level, XP, talent point, and talent-button rows before they could be seen.
- Fixed the talents button reopening the linked panel or disconnecting the player by deferring the page swap instead of closing the linked panel first.
- Fixed stale linked-panel refresh callbacks and already-queued UI commands disconnecting players after opening another command page, including when unlocking talents.

## 2.11.2 - Hytale 0.5.0 Compatibility - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- Updated Tamework for Hytale `0.5.0` release compatibility, including the newer motion, rotation, projectile/event, custom HUD, hotbar, and display-name APIs used by companion commands, spawners, naming, interactions, needs, breeding, damage, and persistence flows.
- Updated release metadata for Hytale `0.5.0` and promoted the package configuration from prerelease/beta to a stable release.
- Renamed the optional asset patch wiki source page to the final asset-patches guide path and refreshed related wiki links.

### Fixed
- Fixed startup failures from stricter runtime asset-pack ID parsing by using parseable generated/self-test pack IDs and only registering the writable self-test pack when `/tw patches selftest` runs.
- Fixed Update 5 compatibility guard coverage for removed velocity APIs and unkeyed custom HUD construction.
- Fixed the `Glowing Purple Mushroom Spores` crafting output display so it matches the two-spore recipe output.

## 2.11.1 - Universal Asset Patches, Live Self-Test, and German Localization - 2026-05-22

### Added
- Expanded optional patching from NPC templates into a generic JSON and JSON-like asset overlay system for server-side assets, including item assets, root/item interactions, Tamework config assets, particles, projectiles, entity effects, drops, and NPC roles/templates.
- Added generated-patch hot-reload observation so `/tw patches reload` can report generated targets, hot-reloaded targets, and targets that require a restart instead of assuming every asset family reloaded safely.
- Added `/tw patches selftest` and `/tw patches selftest cleanup` so operators can validate patch generation and reload classification in-game with isolated fixtures for NPC role/template, item action, Tamework config, `.particlesystem`, and common asset targets.
- Added German localization.

### Changed
- Updated the README and wiki to describe asset patches as a generic optional-dependency system rather than an NPC-template-only workflow.
- Renamed the optional patch wiki pages from NPC template patch pages to asset patch pages.

### Fixed
- Optional asset patches now generate before server JSON asset validation so vanilla-safe downstream assets can receive Tamework-only actions and configs when Tamework is installed.
- Non-`.json` JSON-like targets such as `.particlesystem` assets are now published safely into the generated patch pack.

## 2.11.0 - Optional Template Patches, Attachment Display Names, and Spawner Icon Tooling - 2026-05-21

### Added
- Added `TwAttachmentDisplayConfig` so mods can define player-friendly attachment names once and have captured spawner tooltips show those labels when DynamicTooltipsLib is installed.
- Added optional NPC template patches so third-party mods can ship Tamework role/template integrations without making Tamework a required dependency.
- Added `/tw patches status` and `/tw patches reload` so operators can inspect optional template patch results and refresh generated patch packs without restarting the server.
- Added `Mob_Tamework_Example_Patch` as a bundled optional-patch test NPC whose base template stays barebones until `Server/Tamework/Patches` upgrades it with Tamework behavior.
- Added spawner icon batch manifests and generator support for shared override groups, group defaults, replacement runs, excluded attachment options, and auto-framed Blockbench renders.

### Fixed
- Fixed the Blockbench spawner icon batch renderer leaving every rendered model open as a separate Blockbench tab during large icon-generation runs.
- Fixed spawner icon generation merging duplicate groups incorrectly and missing batch source assets in larger render sets.
- Fixed captured spawner tooltips and linked companion panels showing tamed role IDs when the role asset points at a different display-name translation key.

### Removed
- Removed the outdated Hytalor patch example assets from the bundled examples now that Tamework has its own optional template patch system.

## 2.10.1 - Mushroom Spore Crafting Balance - 2026-05-16

### Changed
- Updated `Glowing Purple Mushroom Spores` crafting to produce two spores per craft, letting one mushroom create two plantable seeds.

## 2.10.0 - Flying Mounts (Beta), Role-Line Breeding, and Attachment Migrations - 2026-05-13

### Added
- (beta) Added a custom mounted flight controller
- Added role-line inheritance to `TwBreedingConfig` so offspring can inherit parent body/model variants, use weighted family lines, and optionally mutate into non-parent lines.
- Added role-scoped `TwAttachmentMigrationConfig` assets so mods can backfill newly split attachment slots from legacy stored selections without overwriting already-randomized values.
- Added a public Trait Effects API so integrations can register custom `TwTraitConfig` effect keys and execute them during Tamework's existing trait-effect resyncs.
- Added `Breed.ManualSelectionSeconds` for manual breeding interactions; players now manually select both intended parents, and manual breeding remains available even when passive breeding or the per-NPC breeding toggle is disabled.
- Skipped breeding happiness thresholds for both manual and passive breeding when the happiness system or breeding happiness requirement is disabled.

### Fixed
- Fixed Tamework-managed attachment sync restoring harvestable fur/wool visuals while a harvested NPC is still on cooldown.
- Fixed linked companion panels showing generic base-species labels when a role-specific translation exists, such as body-type cat variants.

## 2.10.0-Update5-Prerelease - Update 5 Pre-Release Compatibility - 2026-05-07

### Changed
- Updated Tamework for Hytale Update 5 pre-release APIs, including the renamed vector package, quaternion rotation helpers, projectile/event signatures, and NPC/component access changes used by companion commands, spawners, naming, interactions, needs, breeding, damage, and persistence flows.
- Updated player hotbar access to read the Update 5 hotbar component, restoring contextual prompts, item-sensitive interactions, command tools, naming items, and spawner item behavior.
- Updated custom NPC display-name handling to write both persistent and runtime display-name components required by Update 5.
- Updated release metadata for the 2026.05.07 Update 5 pre-release server build and marked this build as a beta/prerelease release for platform publishing.

### Fixed
- Fixed startup failure on Update 5 caused by removed `com.hypixel.hytale.math.vector.Vector3d` / `Vector3f` / `Vector3i` classes.
- Fixed Update 5 command/interaction targeting paths that depended on older inventory, rotation, and display-name APIs.
- Fixed Maven test configuration so caller-provided Surefire `argLine` values are preserved while still installing the Hytale log manager for tests.

### Changed
- Made `/tw settings` the primary owner for common server runtime policy and hid duplicated legacy fields from `/tw config` and shipped example assets.

## 2.9.0 - Companion Controls, Gender Breeding, and Embedded Telemetry - 2026-05-04

### Added
- Added `/tw showspawnmarkers [radius|off]` to render nearby loaded Hytale spawn markers with bright-pink player-local debug shapes and print marker IDs, NPC options, positions, spawn counts, manual-trigger status, and suppression state.
- Added `/tw deletespawnmarker [range]` to delete the closest loaded spawn marker in the player's view path, clear the source block marker component when available, and report the marker ID, NPC options, and position.
- Added optional gender support to `TwBreedingConfig` so modders can require male/female breeding pairs, preserve gender through growth/spawner metadata, show gender in linked panels and spawner tooltips, and use gender-aware random name pools.
- Added a `/tw settings` toggle for companion breeding genders, enabled by default, so server owners can disable gender assignment and gender-aware breeding checks without editing assets.
- Added a `/tw settings` toggle to disable recall/return-home teleporting, hiding Recall actions while disabled, plus a linked-panel Locate action that opens a copyable current or last recorded companion location page.
- Added `TameworkProgressionTimeScales` so integrations can apply per-world progression time multipliers for systems such as breeding timers, with cleanup when worlds are removed.

### Changed
- Switched Tamework to the shared embedded Alec's Telemetry runtime dependency instead of carrying the runtime sources directly in the mod.
- Moved `/tw settings` telemetry persistence into `universe/Tamework/Settings/tamework-settings.json`, with legacy crash telemetry opt-out files imported without deleting them.

### Fixed
- Fixed `/tw npcspawntamed` attachment overrides being replaced by the NPC's initial random attachment choice after the sync system ran.
- Fixed linked companion respawn, lost-recovery, and auto-link record writes so Locate keeps the known world name immediately after a replacement link is created.
- Fixed legacy telemetry settings imports, including old telemetry paths, migration roots, and text boolean values from earlier builds.
- Fixed custom NPC names staying visible while a player is mounted by making mounted-name hiding and restoration self-correct during world ticks.

## 2.8.6 - Breeding Families + Runtime Compatibility - 2026-04-26

### Added
- Added family-based breeding compatibility so related adult roles can breed together, optionally require different adult roles, share a baby role, and persist a weighted future adult role for growth. Existing same-role breeding configs remain valid.
- Added typed telemetry event context for non-crash events so Tamework and downstream integrations can report structured details such as subsystem, phase, operation, target, feature key, runtime side, entity/item/block IDs, command names, and bounded custom detail fields.

### Changed
- Deprecated `Pairing.RequireSameRoleId` in favor of `Pairing.RoleCompatibility`; old configs still read the legacy field, while new defaults, docs, and the config editor use `RoleCompatibility`.
- Updated bundled telemetry routing so Tamework crash/report delivery uses the hosted event ingest endpoint and prefers `eventEndpoint` in embedded project descriptors.

### Fixed
- Fixed player movement speed effects from other mods being applied twice by removing Tamework's player movement effect resync; the base game now remains the only owner for player `HorizontalSpeedMultiplier` movement updates.
- Fixed `/tw showhitboxes` compatibility with Hytale builds where optional debug shape flags are unavailable.
- Fixed typed telemetry event controls, outcomes, and lifecycle details so non-crash telemetry keeps the intended category-specific metadata.

## 2.8.5 - Embedded Telemetry + Flying Companion Grounding - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Added Tamework-managed flying companion landing control support with `TameworkFlyingCompanionComponent`, the `TameworkSetFlyingCompanionMode` action/builder, and a new `FlyingCompanionControlSystem` to help flying companions descend, settle, and hand off into grounded hold states more reliably.
- Added `/tw debugflyingcompanion` plus matching `TwDebugConfig.DebugCommands.FlyingCompanion` support so flying companion landing/grounded handoff diagnostics can be toggled at runtime.

### Changed
- Switched Tamework telemetry over to the bundled embedded Alec's Telemetry runtime so crash, lifecycle, performance, and usage reporting all use one in-jar telemetry path, while preserving the existing `/tw settings` telemetry toggles and `/tw debugcrashtelemetry` tooling.
- Updated the bundled embedded telemetry project descriptor to use Tamework's hosted project key and the `telemetry-dev.alecsmods.com` ingest endpoints while the hosted portal rollout is still under test.

## 2.8.4 - Telemetry Integration + Respawn/Needs Stability - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Added optional Alec's Telemetry integration detection/bridge support plus a bundled telemetry project descriptor for hosted crash, usage, and performance reporting when Alec's Telemetry is installed.
- Added live Alec's Telemetry event emission for `/tw reloadconfig`, `/tw settings`, `/tw news`, and settings-announcement open/review flows, with built-in hosted project defaults for the Tamework telemetry project.
- Added an `Auto-Link` toggle to command-item linked panels so newly tamed companions can automatically bind to the first applicable command item in the player's hotbar or inventory, and breeding offspring can inherit Parent A's command tool binding when their owner is online.

### Changed
- Updated hosted telemetry descriptors/defaults to target the public Alec's Telemetry endpoints instead of local/dev-only endpoints.
- Updated the linked companion command panel to debounce inline text filtering and avoid redundant refresh/binding work during live updates, reducing panel churn with larger companion lists.

### Fixed
- Fixed initial linked companion panel refresh diffing so first-open refreshes no longer do unstable extra redraw work.
- Fixed spawned companions outside breeding inheritance flows losing their initial random attachments when later growing up by seeding stored attachment state during spawn/bootstrap.
- Fixed revived companions carrying stale low-health/needs runtime state after starvation/dehydration deaths and then dying again immediately on respawn.
- Fixed healthy companions still paying the high-frequency natural-regen suppression maintenance cost between normal needs sweeps, reducing unnecessary needs-system work.
- Fixed `/tw debugneedsdamage` spam so diagnostics now only log active suppression/damage work and can flag likely external damage instead of routine healthy ticks.
- Fixed debug telemetry tooling so injected debug events stay constrained to the intended supported telemetry usage flow.
- Fixed command-linked respawn placement safety so revived companions now require real standable clearance and are less likely to respawn embedded in walls.
- Fixed Tamework custom UI localization regressions that could make pages like the group manager show raw `%server...` keys instead of resolved text.

## 2.8.3 - Settings Announcements, Presets, and Needs Diagnostics - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Added a login-time Tamework settings review popup for `/tw settings` access holders, with per-player opt-out tracking and once-per-session dedupe so operators can be re-prompted when a new settings announcement is published.
- Added `/tw news` to reopen the current settings announcement on demand for eligible players, independent of prior opt-out state.
- Added `/tw npcspawntamed` for spawning owned+tamed NPC batches from a requested role id, with optional command-item auto-linking and attachment overrides.
- Added built-in settings announcement localization through `Server/Languages/en-US/server.lang`, with universe config support for either built-in localized copy or raw per-world override text.
- Added `/tw settings` experience presets plus new global toggles for needs, happiness, passive breeding, breeding happiness requirements, and traits so server owners can switch between simplified, easier, and full-experience progression rules without editing assets by hand.
- Added `/tw debugneedsseek` plus throttled seek-target diagnostics so failed hunger/thirst seek passes now report whether they were blocked by need thresholds, missing config/item ids, cached misses, or no resolved water/food target.

### Fixed
- Fixed companion combat target selection so owner hits no longer become retaliation targets during defend/aggressive behavior, including wake-ups from sleep with an owner locked as the target.
- Fixed linked-panel dead companion rows so they can now retain likely death attribution hints such as starvation, dehydration, or the most recent player/NPC killer while keeping revive timing as the primary status text.
- Fixed severe startup hitching around login by skipping redundant companion trait/progression bootstrap work for already-initialized tamed NPCs.
- Fixed dense-NPC interaction prompt lag by caching prompt selections plus repeated settings, path, alarm, item, and requirement lookup work inside prompt evaluation instead of recomputing them every tick.
- Fixed managed coop wild-capture scans doing unnecessary work while coops are roaming, full, or still on capture cooldown, reducing background coop overhead.
- Fixed needs seek scans running too aggressively by gating food/water target searches behind the actual hunger/thirst seek thresholds and caching derived needs config lookups used by the `NeedBelow` sensor.
- Fixed companion water-seeking reliability so dehydrated companions more consistently choose reachable drinking spots near water and can still drink when they are already within water consume range.
- Fixed local singleplayer `/tw settings` and `/tw news` access so the world owner can use them without OP/permission nodes, and added a close-time chat reminder that `/tw settings` can be reopened later.

## 2.8.2 - NameplateBuilder Integration + Health Persistence + Stability - 2026-04-10

### Added
- Added an optional NameplateBuilder integration that overrides the built-in `entity-name` segment with Tamework companion custom names when NameplateBuilder `4.260326.7+` is installed.
- Added optional NameplateBuilder companion segments for happiness, hunger, thirst, tranquilizer status, and traits so players can include companion progression data in their NPC nameplate chains.
- Added optional NameplateBuilder format variants for tranquilizer stacks/time display, shortened companion stat labels, and trait display modes with shortened or full labels plus raw values or linked-panel-style relative percentages.

### Changed
- Updated `Glowing Purple Mushroom Spores` so the seed recipe now also requires one `Glowing Purple Mushroom` in addition to the existing essence cost.

### Fixed
- Fixed startup failure when `SpawningPlugin` is unavailable by treating spawn marker/beacon component types as optional in despawn diagnostics setup.
- Fixed startup crash when SQLite native bindings are unavailable by treating sqlite native linkage failures as recoverable persistence degradation instead of setup-fatal errors.
- Fixed spawner capture/respawn needs restore so companions no longer accrue starvation/dehydration catch-up damage while stored inside capture items.
- Fixed storage-style capture/coop restore flows fully healing companions by persisting current health across stow/release.
- Fixed linked panel captured/offline companion names falling back to raw role ids instead of translated species names.

## 2.8.1 - Post-2.8.0 Stability + Mushroom Spores - 2026-04-10
### Added
- Added `Glowing Purple Mushroom Spores`, a Tier 6 Farming Bench seed recipe that lets players cultivate the mushrooms used for tranquilizer potion crafting.

### Changed
- Updated `Glowing Purple Mushroom` cultivation to use five growth stages, mud-only planting support, and light-sensitive growth modifiers that strongly favor darkness while making direct sunlight nearly stall growth.

### Fixed
- Fixed startup exceptions when duplicate plugin packs are loaded by hardening pack discovery and filtering.
- Fixed needs-damage execution race paths by deferring command-buffer-context damage dispatch, preventing starvation/dehydration death collisions during needs sweep.
- Fixed managed coop resident release placement so the front-of-coop cone follows the coop block's facing and no longer accepts spawn positions more than one block below the coop, preventing releases behind/on top of the coop or into rooms under thin floors.

## 2.8.0 - Settings UI, Crash Telemetry, and Multi-Food Happiness - 2026-04-08
### Added
- Added `/tw settings` UI (`TameworkSettingsPage`) and command wiring with persisted world-level settings storage (`TameworkSettingsStore`).
- Added crash telemetry runtime services (`CrashTelemetryService`, local crash envelope/store, optional HTTP reporting client) with diagnostics/debug command coverage.
- Added base feed-family assets in Tamework: `Tw_Feed_Herbivore` and `Tw_Feed_Carnivore`, including icons/lang keys and global asset-set toggles.
- Added feed impulse mapping support for both item ids and role parameter families (`FeedItemImpulses`, `FeedParamImpulses`) with active-impulse snapshots for linked panel rendering.
- Added needs-damage diagnostics command/toggle coverage (`/tw debugneedsdamage`) for troubleshooting hunger/thirst damage behavior.
- Added `/tw debugspawnerlocation` to isolate spawn-position/raycast diagnostics from general spawner flow diagnostics.
- Added `/tw showhitboxes` to toggle live hitbox/detail-box tracking for the NPC in view (player-local debug rendering).
- Added feed preference resolution helpers/tests for needs-driven container consumption (`FeedItemPreferenceResolver`, regression coverage).
- Added `DamageExecutionWriteSafetyGuardTest` and corresponding contributor guardrail documentation for command-buffer-safe damage execution in runtime system paths.
- Added `StartupResilienceGuardTest` and contributor guardrails for optional setup dependency handling so startup can warn+skip instead of hard-failing.

### Changed
- Reworked companion happiness impulse handling so feed/pet/damage impulses are time-bound, refresh on re-apply, and do not stack as duplicate active buffs.
- Split hand-feed happiness handling from consumed-food impulses (`GainOnFeed` stays hand-feed specific; consumed food uses item/param impulse resolution).
- Updated linked companion tooltip layout and wording to show `Happiness - <current%> -> <target%>`, simplified need modifier labels, and grouped active impulses at the bottom.
- Needs damage is now enabled by default via persisted settings for new worlds/saves and can be toggled in `/tw settings`.
- Updated recipe visibility gating + global config projection to include feed-family toggles and keep toggle-controlled outputs deterministic.
- Updated feed recipes so both `Tw_Feed_Herbivore` and `Tw_Feed_Carnivore` craft `10` items per recipe.
- Simplified `Tw_Feed_Carnivore` crafting input to `10` meat (`Meats`) and removed the fish requirement.
- Added DynamicTooltipsLib to publish metadata optional dependencies.
- Hardened runtime ECS mutation paths so needs/happiness/breeding/mounted-nameplate flows route writes through command-buffer-safe paths during system processing.
- Added architecture safety guard tests and contributor gates to prevent future ECS write-phase and async player-thread-affinity regressions.
- Tranquilizer shortbow adventure-mode fixes were shipped in `2.7.4`; this `2.8.1` section captures the remaining post-`2.7.3` feature set.
- `/tw debugspawner` now focuses on capture/spawn flow diagnostics and logs explicit deny reasons when policy or runtime checks block a request.
- Needs-driven container food consumption now prioritizes higher-value food candidates based on feed impulse preferences instead of consuming the first matching slot.

### Fixed
- Fixed `GainOnPet` and `LoseOnDamage` not being applied by wiring pet-hook and incoming-damage impulse bridges.
- Fixed feed tooltip naming to resolve language keys from canonical consumed item ids (instead of prettified ids).
- Fixed feed impulse tooltip persistence so expired impulses are removed from active display.
- Fixed startup exceptions when duplicate plugin packs are loaded by hardening pack discovery/filtering.
- Fixed additional world-thread crash paths (`Store is currently processing`) in damage/needs/passive-breeding/mounted-nameplate runtime flows by removing direct store writes from system-processing contexts.
- Fixed needs-damage execution race paths in runtime/tick flows by deferring command-buffer-context damage dispatch, preventing starvation/dehydration death collisions during needs sweep.
- Fixed command-linked revivable drop-suppression setup from building a null query input when command-link component types are unavailable during duplicate/partial plugin load states.
- Fixed startup failure when NPC damage drop systems are unavailable by making command-linked revivable drop-suppression system registration optional (warn + skip).
- Fixed startup failure when `Vector3d` is unavailable in constrained runtimes by degrading command-item asset registration/loading gracefully (warn + skip).
- Fixed capture/spawn ownership-requirement evaluation so `RequireOwner` no longer blocks unowned targets/items and still enforces owner match when an owner exists.
- Fixed Soul Lantern/TwSpawner owner checks to consider capture-source ownership metadata during spawn policy evaluation.

## 2.7.4 - Tranquilizer Shortbow Adventure Ammo Fix - 2026-04-06
### Fixed
- Fixed `Weapon_Shortbow_Tranquilizer` failing to fire in `Adventure` mode by replacing inherited crude-arrow primary-shoot ammo handling with tranquilizer-arrow specific primary interactions.
- Fixed tranquilizer shortbow charge-stage ammo flow to match vanilla shortbow stat-driven charge behavior, preventing charge/fail branch desync in adventure combat.

## 2.7.3 - Coop Thread-Affinity Hotfixes - 2026-04-05
### Fixed
- Fixed coop resident release/remap flows that could perform async player component access (`PlayerRef.getComponent(Player)`) from world-tick execution paths.
- Fixed command-linked coop remap fallback behavior by removing global online-player scans from runtime remap logic and limiting remaps to world-safe owner resolution.
- Fixed delayed world-change relocation scheduling to pass player UUIDs across async delay boundaries and resolve live player components only on the world thread.

## 2.7.2 - Config Override Discovery + Breeding Editor Reliability - 2026-04-04
### Added
- Added `/tw npcclean` for role-scoped NPC cleanup in-world.

### Fixed
- Fixed override discovery and reload path handling so configs no longer disappear from mod/global views after apply/reload, including canonical-source and jar-backed source resolution across staging reloads.
- Fixed a coop runtime threading issue by serializing coop tick processing to prevent world-thread concurrent modification failures.
- Fixed breeding config editor behavior for nested role overrides by supporting indexed array-object paths and expanding `RoleOverrides.*.OffspringLifecycle.Families[0].*` fields consistently for staging/reset.

## 2.7.1 - Coop Runtime Gating Hotfix - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- Fixed a coop disable regression where worlds that previously used Alec's Coops could spawn large numbers of chickens around vanilla coops after Alec's Coops was disabled.
- Managed coop capture/release/sync systems now fully short-circuit when no enabled `TwCoopConfig` assets are loaded, preventing stale coop-ledger releases when managed coops are unavailable.

## 2.7.0 - Config Editor Expansion + Managed Coop Reliability - 2026-04-02
### Added
- Expanded `/tw config` from Global-only to multi-family browsing and editing with mod/type/asset navigation, Local/All mod scoping, and per-section field count summaries.
- Added schema-driven tooltip coverage for Tw config fields and surfaced those tooltips in the in-game config editor.
- Added `TwNamesConfig` support with configurable random-name pools and wired naming-item UI randomize flow.
- Added managed-coop resident role support updates for chicks in coop accepted role lists.

### Changed
- Reworked the config editor property grid to preserve inline asset-editor-style editing while improving section state behavior, source chips, and field staging visibility.
- Updated override-path display and config-editor asset selection UX for clearer per-mod/per-family context.
- Moved default chicken coop config ownership to Alec's Coops content and removed the legacy farming coop config asset.

### Fixed
- Fixed multiple config-editor event/binding issues that caused bad selector payloads, non-updating controls, and unstable apply interactions.
- Fixed config reload/apply reliability issues around staged override loading and stale descriptor resolution.
- Fixed managed coop behavior to eject residents when blocking coop blocks are removed.
- Improved offspring spawn placement safety checks to reduce invalid/unsafe spawn attempts.
- Fixed false coop-removal ejections during login/relog by hardening capture sync checks, missing-block handling, and block-state type normalization.

## 2.6.0 - Public API Phase 2/3 + In-Game Self-Tests + UI Localization - 2026-03-30
### Added
- Added `ProgressionApi` reads and controlled mutation operations for happiness, needs, breeding, traits, lifecycle stage, and attachments with explicit mutation-status outcomes.
- Added `InteractionExtensionsApi` registration lifecycle support for custom interaction requirements/effects/presets through the public API boundary.
- Added an in-game `/tw api test` harness with fixture prep/reset commands and suites for core capabilities, config-resolution checks, progression behaviors, and interaction-extension contract smoke checks.
- Added full `/tw api test` report logging to server output so long test runs are preserved outside in-game chat.
- Added comprehensive localization keys and runtime translation fallback support for command notifications, naming flow, linked companion panel text, command menu/group UI, and the config editor.

### Changed
- Expanded and reorganized wiki/API documentation into nested section indexes, per-family public API references, and scenario-driven API recipe tutorials.
- Updated command and linked-panel UI text resolution to be language-aware through centralized key-based lookups instead of hardcoded English strings.
- Improved combat snapshot debug target/parameter resolution used by debugger and API-facing diagnostics flows.

### Fixed
- Fixed first-run instability in progression self-tests by tightening fixture/setup timing and capability-aware baseline checks so suites complete deterministically.

## 2.5.3 - Experimental Integration API - 2026-03-28
### Added
- Added a public Tamework integration API with stable entrypoint access for downstream mods, including profile reads, command-link reads, policy checks, diagnostics, namespaced profile data, config views, and lifecycle/config events.
- Added a read-only `CommandLinksApi` surface for linked tool ids and saved NPC home-position reads so integrations can inspect stored command-link state without reaching into internals.
- Added modder-facing API documentation covering capabilities, null-safe access patterns, event semantics, and namespaced data rules.

### Changed
- Wired config-family asset reloads into the API event stream so live config reloads surface through the same integration boundary used by downstream mods.
- Expanded the read-only API config surface to companion, interaction, spawner, name-item, command-item, happiness, needs, breeding, and trait families with detached DTO views.

### Fixed
- Fixed role-scoped API config detail serialization so integrations and debugger tooling receive JSON payloads instead of serializer failures on raw `Tw*Config` instances.
- Fixed command-link API reads to resolve saved home-position state from live links, snapshot cache, and persisted capture/death/lost snapshots.

## 2.5.2 - Portal Return Threading Fixes - 2026-03-27
### Changed
- Reverted the experimental SQLite native-library resource renaming workaround and restored standard shaded `sqlite-jdbc` packaging for the release artifact.

### Fixed
- Fixed global owner-population cap checks to count foreign-world ownership on each target world's executor instead of directly iterating cross-world stores from the active world thread.
- Fixed post-portal command linking and legacy first-claim ownership acquisition crashing after a player returned from an instance world while global per-player population caps were enabled.
- Fixed breeding's global per-player population cap path to reuse the same cross-world-safe owner counting helper, preventing the same `Store.assertThread()` failure class in breeding checks.

## 2.5.1 - Persistence Refresh + Portal Instance Hotfix - 2026-03-27
### Changed
- Reworked linked companion persistence onto a shared SQLite profile/snapshot schema across capture, lost, death, and coop tracking, with incremental per-record updates instead of broad snapshot table rewrites.
- Updated legacy persistence import and schema migration paths to populate the normalized profile, alias, tool-link, snapshot, coop-slot, and profile-state tables used by the new runtime.
- Linked companion panel trait indicators now support up to four visible traits and use a wider segmented ring layout with refreshed masking/icon presentation.
- Refreshed the project README and modder quick-start docs to better position Tamework as a framework dependency and point modders to the current documentation flow.

### Fixed
- Fixed cross-world instance transfers reloading TwConfig overrides once per generated world path instead of once per shared universe override root, preventing same-universe portal transfers from stalling the world thread.
- Fixed linked capture and lost-companion persistence paths to upsert/delete only the touched records, reducing stale rewrites and keeping profile updates aligned with the new persistence model.

## 2.5.0 - Coop Runtime Rebuild + Update 4 Stability - 2026-03-26
### Added
- Added a Tamework-authoritative coop runtime for pre-release that manages coop intake/release state through a resident ledger keyed by `world + coop block position + resident slot`.
- Added `TwDebugConfig` asset support (`Server/Tamework/Debug`) to define default `/tw debug...` toggle states that are re-applied on startup and `/tw reloadconfig`.

### Changed
- Promoted all `2.4.6-beta` and `2.4.7-prerelease-beta` changes into stable `2.5.0` (see detailed sections below).
- Overhauled `CommandLinkedNpcCoopService` internals into the authoritative coop-ledger facade used by command panel/status flows, release resolution, and UUID remapping.
- Coop release/capture snapshot handling now restores full resident progression/state payloads (owner/tamed/name, links, attachments, needs/happiness, breeding, traits, and lifecycle state) instead of relying on vanilla replacement heuristics.
- `TwCoopConfig` discovery moved to `Server/Tamework/Items/Coops` for the managed coop runtime model.
- Feed trough food/water charge tracking now uses block component state rather than generated per-charge droplist assets.
- Asset codec decode error handling now uses hardened parsing and silences noisy `decodeJson` stderr spam for expected fallback paths.
- Cross-world companion transfer now defers relocation while NPCs are mounted and handles closed source worlds gracefully.

### Fixed
- Fixed coop cycles that left command panel entries stuck in `UNLOADED` after subsequent night/day capture-release passes.
- Fixed coop resident identity/state drift where re-emerged residents could become effectively new/defaultized NPCs instead of restoring the stored resident state.
- Fixed attachment/progression resets across coop and spawner capture-respawn paths, including needs/happiness persistence.
- Fixed remaining coop attachment pop-in by applying attachment restoration earlier in the load/release path.
- Fixed coop snapshot tracking scope so non-coop NPCs no longer enter coop replacement tracking flows.
- Fixed stale mount-owner references and stale role support references during world/portal transfers to reduce cross-store reference crashes.
- Fixed mounted NPC teleport transfer stability by preserving required mount interaction components across chunk/world moves.
- Fixed portal relocation race paths by dismounting players/NPCs before queued teleport relocation is applied.

## 2.4.7-prerelease-beta - Pre-release 2026.03.23 Compatibility - 2026-03-25
### Changed
- Updated Tamework release target to Hytale pre-release `2026.03.23-338988e70`.
- Feed trough container/state handling now uses pre-release `ItemContainerBlock`-backed block entity container data instead of legacy container state metadata.
- Feed trough block variants now use valid pre-release interaction wiring (`Open_Container`/custom `Use` actions) and usable-state flags so trough interactions trigger correctly.
- Feed trough water/food sync, clear-water interaction flow, and companion-needs trough access paths were updated to use the new container component access model.
- Command/spawner inventory update paths were migrated off removed legacy inventory sync calls and now avoid direct calls to deprecated inventory/player methods removed in pre-release.

### Fixed
- Fixed startup crash from missing `world.meta.BlockStateModule` references in feed trough sync registration.
- Fixed startup asset validation failures caused by removed `Break_Container` root interaction references in feed trough assets.
- Fixed feed trough interaction no-op behavior after startup by migrating block container definitions and usable interaction flags to pre-release-compatible schema.
- Fixed world-thread crashes when linking command tools or remapping linked spawner NPCs due to removed `Inventory.markChanged()` and `Player.sendInventory()` methods.

## 2.4.6-beta - Needs Damage, Inheritance Overhaul, and Claim Guardrails - 2026-03-22
### Added
- Added `TwNeedsConfig.TickPolicy` with owner-presence-aware ticking controls (`Mode`, `OwnerOfflineGraceHours`, `OwnerOfflineDecayMultiplier`) and default owner-online grace policy (`72h`, then normal decay).
- Added `TwNeedsConfig.Damage` controls for starvation/dehydration damage (`Enabled`, `Model`, `DualNeedRule`, per-minute rates, `Lethal`), defaulting to disabled for backward-compatible behavior.
- Added owner activity timeline tracking (`OwnerPresenceTimelineService`) seeded from online players at startup and updated from player connect/disconnect events.
- Added optional `TwGlobalConfig.SimpleClaims` integration sections for breeding claim caps (`LimitPerClaimChunk`, `LimitPerClaimTotal`, `BreedingRequiresClaim`) and tamed-NPC damage guardrails (`ProtectTamedFromNonMembers`, `AllowDamagePermissionKey`).
- Added top-level `TwGlobalConfig.Population` owner-cap settings (`LimitPerPlayerOwnedTotal`, `PerPlayerLimitScope` with `PerWorld`/`Global`) used for breeding and tame acquisition.
- Added new linked-panel ring/icon UI assets and wild-berry-red needs/thought particle assets (`Want_Food_Wild_Berry_Red`, `ThoughtCloud_Wild_Berry_Red`).
- Added optional `Buuz135:SimpleClaims` `1.0.x` dependency declaration in `manifest.json`.

### Changed
- Standardized parent-child inheritance behavior across `Tw*Config` assets to nested-aware object inheritance, with explicit child arrays/maps replacing parent values (no append/union merge).
- `TwBreedingConfig` now keeps `RoleOverrides` local-only (not inherited), while `RoleIds` remain inheritable when omitted; codec tooltips now document this explicitly.
- Needs progression now uses owner-presence effective elapsed time for both decay and needs damage: owner-online windows tick fully, offline grace windows can tick at `0`, and post-grace windows apply the configured offline multiplier.
- Owner damage filtering now applies optional SimpleClaims claim-member/permission checks for tamed targets; denied attacks are cancelled, and claim lookup failures fail-open with throttled warnings.
- Breeding population enforcement now combines SimpleClaims claim caps with new per-player owned-NPC caps at pairing precheck, spawn-time recheck/clamp, and passive-sweep reservation scheduling.
- SimpleClaims breeding claim population counts now include all owned NPCs (`TameworkOwnerComponent.ownerId`), not only breedable NPCs.
- New ownership acquisition gates now block player-driven tame claims (interaction taming/set-owner, legacy first-claim bridge, and spawn-assign-owner item spawns) when the owner population cap is reached.
- Linked companion panel vitals rendering now uses refreshed segmented ring/mask visuals and updated runtime ring-anchor binding for needs + breeding cooldown indicators.

### Fixed
- Passive breeding sweep no longer hard-crashes the world thread when passive sweep carrier classes fail to resolve at runtime; sweep failures are logged and skipped for that interval.
- Needs-damage events now bypass trait damage multipliers by source tag, ensuring starvation/dehydration damage follows configured flat rates.
- Linked companions with dead-respawn enabled no longer drop death loot while linked, preventing revive-loop drop duplication.
- Nearby-panel `Cull` now unlinks companions before death is applied, so cull drops still process as normal and culled companions are removed from linked tool records.

## 2.4.5 - Companion Metadata Recovery + Tooltip Bridge - 2026-03-20
### Added
- Added optional DynamicTooltipsLib integration for spawner items, including captured tooltip metadata (`Name`, `Role`) and per-spawner `TooltipMode` (`Additive`/`Replace`) via `TwSpawnerConfig`.
- Added shared linked-companion state snapshot caching used across link, refresh, death, and lost-companion flows to preserve full recovery metadata.

### Changed
- `/tw reloadconfig` now invalidates and refreshes DynamicTooltipsLib tooltip caches when that optional dependency is loaded.

### Fixed
- Lost companion recovery now restores captured metadata (display name, appearance/skin variants, progression traits/state, and command-state context) instead of spawning defaultized replacements.
- Strict lost recovery now prefers shared state snapshots and death-snapshot respawn reconstruction, with stale-original suppression retained for late original reloads.

## 2.4.4 - Companion Travel + Lost Recovery Reliability - 2026-03-19
### Added
- Added strict linked-companion lost-state tracking (`CommandLinkedNpcLost.dat`) wired to relocation retry exhaustion, with persisted original-to-replacement mappings that suppress stale originals if they reappear later.
- Linked companion panel/menu flows now recognize `LOST` companions, block recall/return-home while lost, and allow `Respawn` to perform strict recovery (replacement spawn + anti-dup stale-original suppression mapping).
- Added role-scoped command travel settings under `TwCompanionConfig.Command.Travel`: `CrossWorldRecallEnabled`, `OnTransferFailure`, `FollowMasterOnWorldChange`, and `FollowMasterOnWorldChangeStateFilter`.
- Added automatic companion travel relocation hooks for player world-entry and same-world teleport arrival events.
- Linked companion panel now supports nearby-only `Release` and `Cull` actions behind the existing confirm flow, with ownership/tamed gating for safety.
- Added feed trough asset support (`Tw_Feed_Trough`) with staged food/water block variants, localized open/empty interaction prompts, and generated icon/model assets.
- Added water-trough charge handling through `TameworkClearFeedTroughWater` and `FeedTroughWaterStateService`, including progressive water-state depletion and clear-to-base behavior.
- Added bucket integration mappings so container/deco buckets can refill feed trough water variants to full state.
- Companion needs hydration can now consume nearby feed trough water charges when available.

## 2.4.3 - Defense + Despawn Diagnostics - 2026-03-19
### Added
- Added shared `Want_Food_Charcoal` particle assets (`Want_Food_Charcoal`, `ThoughtCloud_Charcoal`, and `CharcoalThought.png`) so mods can reuse a blank-thought + base charcoal icon food hint.
- Linked panel NPC cards now include a breeding enable/disable toggle (default `off`), and passive/interaction breeding flows now require this per-NPC toggle to be enabled.
- Added `/tw debugdespawn` overloads to support optional role filters for despawn diagnostics (for example `on Tamed_Rat`, `Rat`, and `clear`).
### Fixed
- Defend instruction threat detection now treats mobs that recently attacked the companion itself as valid retaliatory targets (in addition to mobs that attacked `MasterTarget`), so companions no longer ignore direct incoming hits while defending.
- Added immediate tame-flow diagnostics breadcrumbs for role changes when despawn diagnostics are enabled, improving root-cause tracing for intermittent post-tame removals.
- Tame transitions now detach NPCs from spawn-marker/spawn-beacon ownership and clear spawn-tracking state when they become tamed, preventing cave-spawned companions (especially rats) from being reclaimed and removed after role swap.
- Despawn diagnostics now track all tamed companions (instead of rat-only) and include spawn-marker/spawn-beacon reference presence plus linked marker/beacon UUID context on add/remove events.

## 2.4.2 - Interaction + Lifecycle Reliability - 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- Tamework contextual-use targets remain interactable even when their generic `F` prompt is intentionally hidden.
- `/tw debugprompt` now logs raw harvest-alarm resolution details (`exists`, `set`, `unset`, `active`, `passed`, `ready`, and lookup validity) so prompt diagnostics no longer blur together "missing", "unset", and "not ready" states.
- Partial `TwGlobalConfig` assets that only override unrelated sections (for example `AssetSets`) now retain Tamework's built-in interaction defaults, preventing `HarvestAlarmName` and other core interaction param names from becoming `null` at runtime.
- Offspring lifecycle growth without an adolescent role now treats the adult transition as the next stage for baby scaling and duration splits, so baby companions grow toward `AdultSwitchScale` before swapping to the adult role/stage instead of using adolescent fallback scales.
- Offspring lifecycle role overrides now fall back through matching family entries, so adult-keyed lifecycle overrides apply to the configured baby role too and duplicate baby-key override blocks are no longer required.
- Offspring lifecycle adult scale baselines now resolve from the configured adult role's appearance/model asset instead of the spawned baby model, so bred adults inherit the correct adult body size before `SizeMultiplier` traits are applied.

## 2.4.1 - Mounted Companion Hotfix - 2026-03-15
### Fixed
- Mounted companion name hide/restore now preserves existing `Nameplate` archetype membership during mount role swaps, preventing world-thread crashes when mounting or dismounting Tamework companions with custom names.
- Unnamed mounted companions now skip the temporary name-hide path entirely, preventing mount-time crashes that only reproduced when no name was present before mounting.
- Breeding lifecycle diagnostics such as cooldown application and spawn-success traces are no longer emitted at default `INFO` level during normal gameplay.

## 2.4.0 - Tranquilizer + Command UX + Metrics - 2026-03-14
### Added
- Interaction `Requires` now supports `NpcHealthPercent` checks with comparison operators (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`) against a `0-100` health-percent threshold.
- New NPC sensor builder `TameworkEffectActive` for role instructions/sensors, including optional `MinRemainingSeconds` checks for effect-duration thresholds.
- New tranquilizer combat assets: `Tw_Status_Tranquilized` status effect, `Weapon_Arrow_Tranquilizer` ammo, and a cobalt-based `Weapon_Shortbow_Tranquilizer` with tranquilizer projectile variants.
- New dedicated tranquilizer status particle system `Effect_Tranquilizer` (no poison-face overlay) with a custom purple bubble texture (`Effect_Tranquilizer_Bubble.png`) for `Tw_Status_Tranquilized`.
- Added `TwGlobalConfig.AssetSets` opt-in gates (`TranquilizerShortbow`, `TranquilizerArrow`, `TranquilizerPotion`) plus recipe-visibility reconciliation that removes gated tranquilizer recipes from crafting registries (and restores them when enabled).
- Command item configs now support optional `MaxActive` limits, allowing more linked NPCs than active command recipients (`0` keeps the previous unlimited-active behavior).
- Added HStats integration for anonymous Tamework usage metrics reporting, including server-owner opt-out support through `hstats-server-uuid.txt`.
- Added Tamework-side HStats forwarding for tracked Alec dependency asset packs (Cats, Animal Husbandry, Nametags) when installed and declaring a Tamework dependency.
### Fixed
- Linked panel card `INACTIVE` status indicator now uses the same lower status lane as `CONFIRM REMOVE`, avoiding overlap with trait icons.
- Added shared `Component_Tamework_ActionList_StandUp` to Tamework assets so mods referencing stand-up wake transitions (for example tamed predator templates copied from cat-pet behavior) validate without requiring Alec's Cats assets.
- Added `TranquilizerEffectExpirySyncSystem` to force an explicit `COMPLETE` effect-remove network update for `Tw_Status_Tranquilized` during the expiry window (including already-zero remaining duration), preventing lingering tranquilizer particles on clients after natural expiry.
- Tranquilizer status particles now use dedicated finite-budget spawners (`Tranquilizer_Cloud` + bounded `Tranquilizer_Bubble`) so cloud/bubble visuals self-terminate instead of running indefinitely if an engine-side detach/update is missed.
- Tuned tranquilizer fallback particle budgets so cloud/bubble self-termination aligns much closer to the intended 30s tranquilizer duration when detach updates are missed.
- Further tuned tranquilizer fallback particle budgets from live timing checks (cloud/bubble) to tighten self-termination toward the target 30s window.
- Reworked tranquilizer particles to short pulse-style emissions: `Effect_Tranquilizer` now uses a short system lifespan and burst-like cloud/bubble spawner settings so repeated status-driven emits handle the ongoing look while each individual particle instance self-terminates quickly.
- Tame/role-swap interaction flows now explicitly clear `Tw_Status_Tranquilized` before role change, preventing tranquilizer cloud/bubble particles from persisting after taming (including multi-hit tranquilizer cases).
- `Tw_Status_Tranquilized` no longer applies the poison-style `Hurt` status animation pulse, so tranquilized NPCs keep normal sleep/idle posture unless struck by actual hit impact.
- Mounted NPCs now hide active custom nameplates while ridden and restore the previous/custom name after dismount, preventing overhead names from overlapping rider camera/body views.
- Command item feedback sounds now play as local 2D audio for the player using the item, while nearby other players hear the configured in-world 3D sound.

## 2.3.0 - Linked NPC Panel Modes, Grouping, and UX Refinements - 2026-03-11
### Added
- Command linked panel now supports explicit per-tool modes (`LinkedMode`, `NearbyMode`) with nearby radius controls.
- Linked panel now supports per-tool sorting (`Default`, `Name`, `Species`, `Group`) and filtering (`None`, `Name`, `Species`, `Group`) via dropdown controls.
- Linked panel rows now support active/inactive state toggles; inactive NPCs remain visible and can still receive per-row recall/return-home while being excluded from bulk command dispatch.
- Linked panel cards now show breeding cooldown progress rings with compact real-time countdown tooltip text (`Breeding CD`).
- Added command-group metadata persistence for tools and linked NPC records, including group id + color/name display metadata.
- Added `Manage Groups` flow with create/edit/delete operations, row-level inline edit mode, and color-picker-based group colors.
- Linked NPC cards now include a left-side group indicator tab that reflects assigned group color and opens group assignment.

### Changed
- Linked panel control layout was consolidated and tightened for small-panel readability: mode dropdown in header, nearby radius controls on the subtitle row, and compact sort/filter controls.
- Linked panel title now reflects mode (`Linked NPCs` vs `Nearby NPCs`).
- Group assignment now uses an inline overlay on the main selection panel (no panel-close/page-swap flow), preserving panel context and reducing transition flash.
- Group assignment applies auto-link-then-assign behavior when assigning a non-`None` group to an unlinked owned NPC.

### Fixed
- Species filtering now uses consistent role-id resolution across linked and nearby entries, including legacy fallback handling.
- Resolved multiple CustomUI binding/selector issues in group manager and group-assignment flows (create/close no-op cases, color picker property binding mismatches, and action payload gathering issues).
- Resolved command panel transition/input-lock issues when navigating between main panel and group manager.
- Resolved inline group assignment `Apply` handling so apply events carrying both value + action are processed reliably.
- Group tab indicator alignment and sizing were corrected for card row centering and visibility.

## 2.2.1 - Companion Policy, Interaction QoL, and Config Scope Updates - 2026-03-08
### Added
- New lag diagnostics toggle command: `/tw debuglag [on|off]` for targeted server performance logging.
- Legacy-tamed ownership bridge for mid-playthrough installs: vanilla `Tamed_*` NPCs without Tamework owner data can now be claimed on first eligible owner interaction/link flow.
- Interaction requirement item matching now supports inverse operators (for example `ItemsInHand.Operator: NoneOf`) for custom "wrong item"/"not holding item set" flows.
- Interaction particle effects now support param-driven attachment targeting (`AttachTarget`, `AttachNode`, `OffsetParam`) with optional player-only visibility control.
- New role-scoped companion policy asset type: `TwCompanionConfig` (`Server/Tamework/Companion`), with priority + parent fallback support for ownership protection and command behavior tuning.
- Companion/global command cooldown config now supports `DeadRespawnCooldownMins` as a human-friendly alias, with minutes overriding `DeadRespawnCooldownMs` when both are present.

### Changed
- Added guarded lag-probe logging in command, spawner, and naming item interactions, owner-interaction filtering, owner damage filtering, and command relocation retries/chunk requests when lag diagnostics are enabled.
- `-Prun-server` now supports optional JVM/server argument passthrough properties (`-Dhytale.server.jvm.args` and `-Dhytale.server.extra.args`) for local resource-constrained runs.
- Owner damage filtering and command companion behavior now resolve policy by companion role through `TwCompanionConfig`, with automatic fallback to `TwGlobalConfig` when no role-scoped companion policy is configured.
- Command dead-respawn cooldown windows are now captured per companion role at death-snapshot time (role policy aware) instead of using a single global cooldown.
- `TwGlobalConfig_Default` now only includes truly global settings (`General`, `InteractionDefaults`, command relocation infrastructure + linked-panel unlink confirmation); ownership protection and per-companion command behavior defaults now live under `TwCompanionConfig`.

### Fixed
- Manage Groups create/rename/recolor actions now use live input drafts reliably, fixing cases where group create/edit actions did not apply.
- `Component_Tamework_Instruction_SeekFood_PlayerFollow` now uses valid sensor/filter combinations (no invalid `Player` filter builder), restoring clean NPC builder validation for livestock templates that reference it.
- Interaction particle spawning now uses the vanilla-compatible model-particle packet path for node/entity attachments, with stable world-space positioning.
- Particle tint application now uses packet-level color assignment (instead of unavailable `ModelParticle#setColor`), preventing interaction-triggered runtime errors.

## 2.2.0 - Progression, Coop Integration, and UI/Behavior Refinements - 2026-03-07
### Added
- Foundation breeding and traits asset types: `TwBreedingConfig` and `TwTraitConfig`, including role-priority resolution and default example assets.
- Foundation shared happiness asset type: `TwHappinessConfig`, including role-priority resolution and default example assets.
- Foundation needs asset type: `TwNeedsConfig`, including role-priority resolution and default hunger/thirst config under `Server/Tamework/Needs`.
- New coop integration asset type: `TwCoopConfig` under `Server/Tamework/Farming/Coops`, keyed by `CoopId` with priority-aware selection and parent fallback support.
- New progression components: `TameworkBreedingComponent` and `TameworkTraitsComponent`, plus bootstrap initialization for newly tamed companions.
- New shared progression component: `TameworkHappinessComponent` with config id, value, and last-update timestamp.
- New shared progression component: `TameworkNeedsComponent` with hunger/thirst values, passive-sweep tracking, and applied happiness penalty state.
- New progression component: `TameworkAttachmentsComponent` for persisted model attachment selections used by offspring appearance inheritance.
- Progression persistence bridges for spawner capture/spawn and command-linked death/respawn snapshots (breeding + traits fields).
- Initial `Breed` interaction handling for happiness-gated readiness state setup.
- Unit tests for breeding/traits priority resolution and trait-value metadata codec round-trips.
- Deterministic trait assignment service (`TraitRollService`) with duplicate/conflict enforcement and seed-based rolls.
- Trait modifier resolver service (`TraitModifierService`) for effect-key multiplier lookups from rolled trait values.
- Unit tests for trait roll determinism/conflict handling and trait modifier multiplier resolution.
- `/tw gethappiness` command to inspect targeted NPC happiness source/value and breeding eligibility context.
- `/tw getneeds` command to inspect targeted NPC hunger/thirst state, applied needs penalty, and needs timing/config context.
- `/tw setneeds <hunger> <thirst>`, `/tw sethunger <value>`, and `/tw setthirst <value>` debug commands for direct in-game needs tuning on targeted NPCs.
- `/tw sethappiness <value>` and `/tw gettraits` commands for in-game progression debugging and balancing.
- `/tw settraits <TraitId> <Value> [TraitId Value ...]` and `/tw addtrait <TraitId> <Value>` debug commands for explicit trait assignment on targeted NPCs.
- `/tw setbreedingready [true|false|toggle]` debug command to force/clear breeding readiness on the targeted NPC (including cooldown clear when forcing ready).
- New life-stage progression component/service (`TameworkLifeStageComponent`, `CompanionLifeStageService`) plus `/tw getlifestage` debugging command.
- `/tw findnpc <uuid> [mark:on|off]` command to resolve a specific NPC by UUID, print live world state, and optionally mark its location with particles.
- Unit tests covering trait inheritance blending/mutation bounds and life-stage transition/scale interpolation behavior.

### Changed
- Plugin bootstrapping now registers breeding/traits asset stores and component codecs.
- Coop capture-crate intake now supports optional Tamework policy overlays when a matching `TwCoopConfig` exists, while still using vanilla coop admission gates (`tryPutResident`) for resident-capacity/species acceptance parity.
- Interaction/docs coverage updated to reflect current breeding behavior (no longer a pure stub path).
- Interaction requirement buckets now support `PlayerHandEmpty` for explicit empty-hand gating.
- Interaction `Requires.Parameter` matching now evaluates all resolved role scopes (role/global/exec/sensor fallback) instead of only a single scope, fixing false negatives for valid params such as boolean flags.
- Trait bootstrap now backfills empty trait components with deterministic rolls and role-config IDs.
- Feeding interactions now apply shared happiness gains from happiness config (or shared defaults when no happiness config resolves), including trait-based `HappinessGainMultiplier` scaling.
- Feeding interactions now also apply manual needs refill (`hunger`, plus optional `thirst` for configured water-bucket items), while the new `CompanionNeedsSystem` handles periodic hunger/thirst decay, passive container feed, passive water drinking, and needs-driven happiness penalties.
- Needs progression now supports sensor-driven resource seeking: low-thirst companions can target adjacent drink positions near water, low-hunger companions can target adjacent eat positions near food containers using role `FoodItemIDs`, and `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Needs_Seek_Resource` now enters seek states through needs/resource sensors rather than hook triggers.
- Needs passive refill and needs-resource seek scans now support configurable vertical search depth via `PassiveRefill.ContainerVerticalScanRadius` and `PassiveRefill.WaterVerticalScanRadius`.
- Breeding config resolution now supports direct config-id lookup (`resolveById`) and shared resolver usage across breeding/spawner/respawn paths.
- Happiness updates now route through shared `CompanionHappinessService` (with `BreedingHappinessService` retained as a compatibility shim), keeping architecture open for non-breeding consumers.
- Equilibrium happiness modifiers now support population bands (`Modifiers.Population`) with configurable nearby same-type radius and count ranges, enabling lonely/social/crowded offsets.
- Disposition (`HappinessGainMultiplier`) now scales all happiness deltas and equilibrium modifiers: positive contributions scale directly by disposition, while negative contributions are inversely scaled so high disposition softens detractors and low disposition amplifies them.
- Spawner metadata and command death/respawn snapshots now persist shared happiness state and restore breeding happiness from that shared source for backward-compatible migration.
- Breed interaction eligibility now evaluates effective fertility using trait key `FertilityMultiplier` plus optional interaction `FertilityBonus` before readiness is set.
- Breed interaction eligibility now enforces `TwBreedingConfig.Eligibility.RequireNotSleeping` and `RequireNotInCombat` state gates in addition to tame checks.
- `TwInteractionConfig_Example` now includes a crouch-gated owner `Breed` entry for `Mob_Tamework_Example` so breeding readiness can be tested in-game.
- Breeding now performs nearby partner matching and applies a staged sequence (parent approach movement -> hearts particles -> delayed offspring spawn).
- Breeding parent approach now prefers role-driven pair movement via `Tamework.Breeding.Pair.Start` + `BreedPair` state hooks, with proximity-gated hearts/spawn and fallback direct move for roles without pair-state support.
- Breeding pair movement now keeps parents in pair state briefly after arrival (about 1s) before resetting, and offspring spawn delay after hearts is slightly longer for clearer pacing.
- Breeding hearts trigger sooner after pair arrival by using faster proximity checks and a less strict pairing-ready distance threshold.
- Offspring spawning now supports role baby-variant selection with fallback juvenile scaling, trait inheritance via `TraitInheritanceService`, and alarm-backed parent/offspring breeding cooldown locks.
- Breeding inheritance now supports deterministic random attachment inheritance with weighted parent/random selection and mutation (`TwBreedingConfig.Inheritance.AttachmentInheritance`), and offspring attachment selections now persist and reapply across runtime role/model transitions.
- Breeding cooldown and offspring lifecycle growth durations now use game-time timestamps with configurable conversion basis (`TwBreedingConfig.Timing.Basis`), while remaining authored in human-readable seconds.
- Adult breeding gates now use explicit life-stage progression when present (with role-name fallback), and life-stage state now persists through spawner capture/spawn and command death/respawn snapshots.
- Breeding offspring spawn now retries nearby fallback positions and uses additional role-resolution fallbacks to prevent silent no-spawn outcomes after successful pairing/hearts.
- Breed interaction custom effects now apply only when breeding actually starts, preventing false-positive "ready" feedback when blocked (for example by cooldown).
- `/tw gethappiness` now reports breeding cooldown state (`cooldownActive`, `cooldownRemainingMs`, `cooldownUntilMs`) and `readyNow` to clarify readiness vs cooldown.
- Offspring spawn diagnostics now include async failure logging, and newborns spawn slightly higher with child hearts for easier visual confirmation.
- Non-baby-variant life-stage scaling now uses smaller juvenile defaults again (`baby=0.55`, `adolescent=0.80`) now that juvenile model-visibility issues were fixed.
- Breeding offspring placement now prioritizes wider horizontal offsets and higher vertical fallback offsets to reduce parent-overlap/terrain clipping.
- Breeding heart-particle spawn now resolves NPC role-template `ParticleOffset` when available (with fallback to default offset), so vanilla and third-party templates can control breeding particle placement.
- Juvenile model scaling now preserves random attachment IDs from the current model when rebuilding scaled models, fixing invisible offspring where required attachments were being dropped during scale updates.
- `Template_Tamework_Example`/`Template_Tamework_Example_Vanilla` now use wander-driven `Idle` behavior and an explicit `Follow` state, and the example command item now sets `Follow`/`Recall` to state `Follow`.
- Breeding offspring progression now creates a vanilla family flock (new flock per breeding family), assigns one parent as the flock anchor, and moves the other parent plus offspring into `FlockFollow` behavior using a new `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Flock_Follow_Wander` asset (vanilla leash-to-leader + local wander).
- Linked companions panel cards now render up to three rolled trait indicators with icon glyphs and directional ring-fill progress (counter-clockwise green for above-default values, clockwise red for below-default values).
- Trait indicator icons in the linked companions panel now show hover tooltips with full trait names and normalized value context (`current / max` plus percent of max).
- Trait-based max-health scaling is now wired through `MaxHealthMultiplier`, applying/removing a dedicated health-max stat modifier during progression bootstrap, offspring initialization, and command respawn restoration.
- Existing companions with persisted traits now have trait stat modifiers resynced on world/entity load via `CompanionTraitStatSyncSystem`, so health trait effects no longer require retriggering tame/bootstrap flows.
- Linked companions panel cards now keep health as a bar and render happiness/hunger/thirst as compact circular progress meters with hover tooltips, reducing card crowding while preserving quick-status visibility.
- Linked companions panel needs rings now render texture icons (happiness/food/water) instead of letter glyphs, preserving 32x32 source art while displaying icons at compact ring-center size.
- Linked companions panel cards now render health value text directly over the health bar (`current/max`) using a centered overlay for better space usage and readability.
- Linked companions panel card container spacing has been tightened (reduced card height/top offset) to remove excess blank space between card content and the next entry.
- Linked companions panel now keeps framed card-row backgrounds while removing the list viewport frame to avoid a nested/double-layered panel look.
- Linked companions panel list top inset has been reduced so the first card sits closer to the subtitle/separator area, matching side inset spacing more closely.
- Linked companions trait rings now support optional texture icons from trait config (`TwTraitConfig.Traits[].IconPath`); trait icon glyph fallback remains in place when no icon path is configured.
- Trait roll count per spawn now supports weighted variable outcomes (`Selection.RollCountWeights` for 0..4), with default weighting centered on 2 rolls and 4-roll outcomes kept rare.
- Trait selection config has been simplified to remove stacked fallback layers: `Selection.MaxTraitsPerNpc` is now the single count/cap control, duplicate handling is unified under `Selection.AllowDuplicateTraits`, and legacy `Selection.RerollDuplicates` + `Stacking` fields are removed.
- Trait inheritance now supports per-trait inheritance weighting (`Traits[].InheritanceWeight`) and same-direction parent alignment range bias (`Inheritance.PairAlignmentRangeInfluence`) so high-high or low-low pairings can push offspring values further toward configured trait bounds.
- Trait schema now separates natural-spawn vs breeding ranges (`Traits[].NaturalMin/NaturalMax` and `Traits[].BreedingMin/BreedingMax`): spawn/non-inherited rolls use natural bounds, while inherited/mutated rolls and trait UI "max possible" calculations use breeding bounds.
- Added baseline trait definitions for swiftness, toughness, strength, and foraging luck in the default trait config.
- Swiftness now applies runtime move-speed effects by snapping `MoveSpeedMultiplier` trait values to quantized `Entity/Effects` tiers (`Tw_Trait_MoveSpeed_###`).
- Renamed the harvest double-drop trait display name from `Foraging Luck` to `Bounty` for clearer harvest-output semantics.
- Added baseline `Size` trait definition in default trait config (`SizeMultiplier`) so life-stage/adult scale can roll from trait progression.
- Damage processing now applies trait multipliers for both incoming (`DamageTakenMultiplier`) and outgoing (`DamageDealtMultiplier`) damage.
- Harvest interactions can now trait-proc double drops via `HarvestDoubleDropChanceMultiplier` (interpreted as `chance = clamp(multiplier - 1, 0..1)`).
- Template-driven harvest drops now use `TameworkHarvestDrop`, enabling Bounty trait bonus drops in `$Harvest` state flows (not only interaction `Effects.DropItem`).

### Fixed
- Tamework's embedded jar asset pack now registers into AssetEditor's data-source map when missing, so Tamework assets appear in the pack dropdown as read-only and can be duplicated into custom packs.
- Fixed a world-thread crash in `CommandLinkedNpcDeathService` when recording death snapshots for linked NPCs that had neither shared happiness nor breeding happiness (null-safe fallback now avoids `Double` auto-unboxing).
- Tamed companions and companions with persisted custom names are now opted out of vanilla overpopulation despawn checks, preventing accidental despawn of owned/named NPCs.
- Needs-seek runtime now immediately exits to parent completion state when no readable seek target is present, preventing companions from getting stuck in `NeedsSeekFood.Default` / `NeedsSeekWater.Default`.
- Needs-seek movement now uses pathfinder by default and aborts immediately when nav reports `Defer`, preventing companions from remaining stuck against blocked/unreachable resource targets (for example encased food containers).
- Needs-seek now applies a failed-seek cooldown timer (`NeedsSeek_Failed_Cooldown`) and sensor-side cooldown gating, preventing rapid re-entry loops into needs-seek states when nearby targets repeatedly fail pathing.
- Fixed breeding pair state completion flow so `BreedPair` no longer stalls after arrival, and breeding pair start now clears lingering status posture animation to prevent slide-like movement.
- Breeding pair completion now uses timer-driven exit flow (arrival delay + move-timeout fail-safe), and close-range completion follows `SeekStopDistance + 0.15` for tight pair-up spacing without getting stuck in `BreedPair`.
- Tamed companions now self-heal missing/invalid shared happiness state on world load (including `NaN`/non-finite values), so reloads no longer leave companions reporting "no tracked happiness state."
- Companion progression bootstrap-on-load now waits for both NPC + `TameworkTamedComponent` before running, fixing a load-order race where some tamed companions could skip happiness/progression bootstrap after reload.
- Companion progression bootstrap-on-load now defers work through `CommandBuffer.run(...)`, preventing chunk-load crashes from direct `Store.putComponent(...)` calls during store-processing callbacks.
- Breeding offspring progression now bootstraps tamed newborn progression immediately after spawn, ensuring shared happiness state exists at birth instead of appearing as unavailable until a reload heal pass.
- Passive needs ticks no longer apply manual feed gains each sweep; manual needs refill remains interaction-driven only.

## 2.1.3 - Naming UI and Command UI Polish - 2026-02-24
### Added
- New `TameworkNameInputPage` custom UI used by naming items for direct in-page text entry with `Apply` / `Cancel` actions.

### Changed
- Naming items now open the naming UI by default instead of requiring chat input; when the page cannot be opened, naming safely falls back to the legacy chat prompt flow.
- Name input UI now uses vanilla-style decorated container framing with compact action buttons.
- Linked companions side panel now uses vanilla-style decorated container framing and framed list/card surfaces.
- Command radial slices, linked panel action icon buttons, and naming action buttons now use standard button hover/click sounds for consistency with base UI behavior.

## 2.1.2 - Wander and Ambient Behavior Refinements - 2026-02-23
### Added
- New `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Wander` component for reusable random wandering within a configurable radius.
- New `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Ambient_Idle` component that centralizes reusable ambient posture/flavor/sleep behavior for idle-style states.
### Changed
- `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Wander` now explicitly supports `AvoidBlockDamage` (default `true`) so wander motion can avoid environmental-damage blocks (for example, fire/brambles when flagged as damaging).
- `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Hold` is now a thin wrapper that initializes sleep gates and delegates ambient behavior to `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Ambient_Idle`.
- `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Wander` now supports move/settle cycles and can run ambient posture/flavor/sleep behavior during settle windows (including optional sleep transitions).
- `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Wander` now supports optional settle-exit transition animation + delay (`SettleExitAnimation`, `SettleExitDelayRange`) to prevent posture sliding when resuming movement.
- `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Wander` now re-rolls move vs settle choice on each `.Default` pass so settle/flavor branches are consistently reachable during wander.
- `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Ambient_Idle` now uses shorter ambient reroll windows with flavor cooldown gating so hold/settle behaviors do not chain flavor animations back-to-back indefinitely.
- `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Follow_Simple_TP` now separates owner lock-on range (`FollowLockOnRange`) from seek threshold (`FollowSeekRange`) so simple follow reliably teleports when the owner is outside seek distance.
- `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Follow_Advanced` now separates seek threshold (`FollowSeekRange`) from teleport fallback so teleport can execute reliably when the owner is outside seek distance.
- `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Wander` now enters settle through an explicit posture-entry stage (`.SettleEnter`) so settle posture is applied consistently before ambient settle logic runs.
- `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Hold` now explicitly reapplies hold posture on Hold entry instead of relying on shared ambient one-shot posture initialization.

## 2.1.1 - Linked Companions Panel UX and Safety - 2026-02-21
### Added
- Linked Companions side panel with per-NPC actions: `Recall`, `Set Home`, `Return Home`, and `Unlink`.
- Dead companion state tracking with cooldown-based `Revive` action from the linked panel.
- New command/dead-recovery config options in `TwGlobalConfig` (unlink confirmation, revive enable/cooldown, respawn/follow retry tuning, and placement tuning).

### Changed
- Linked panel rows now refresh health, death cooldown, and status in-place once per second while open.
- Linked panel actions now use compact icon buttons with tooltips, including a dedicated `Revive` icon state.
- Unloaded companion naming now uses cached identity fallback priority: `Display Name > Name Key > Role ID`.
- `TwGlobalConfig_Default.json` is now grouped into top-level sections (`General`, `OwnershipProtection`, `InteractionDefaults`, `Command`).
- Recall and Revive now share the same safe-placement pipeline with off-camera-biased randomized sampling.

### Fixed
- Linked-panel icon textures now load correctly from `Common/UI/Custom/Tamework` (no missing-texture placeholders).
- Dead companion snapshots now persist across relog/server restart and remain revivable after cooldown.
- Revived companions now spawn more safely and reliably re-enter follow behavior.
- Unloaded recall/rehome flow is now consistent and more reliable after relog, including first-attempt recall in previously inconsistent cases.
- Relocation queueing/probing was hardened to prevent world-thread stalls from retry floods.

### Notes
- Linked-companions row UI now includes hidden scaffolding for future secondary stats and action buttons (traits/talents), so the panel can be extended without another structural UI rewrite.

## 2.1.0 - Command Items Beta and Asset Loading Fixes - 2026-02-19
### Added
- New command item config asset type **TwCommandItemConfig** under `Server/Tamework/Items/Commands`, plus the `TameworkCommand` item interaction and example command whistle assets.
- Command item runtime support for per-tool linking, selected-command metadata, command-step execution, and command feedback (chat/HUD/sound/particles).
- Command selection radial UI page (`TameworkCommandRadialMenu.ui`) opened via secondary use (`CommandId: OpenSelectionMenu`) with clickable slice buttons.
- New `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Command_Move` instruction bridge for move-to-ping/return-home hooks.
- `TameworkHook` now exposes hook target-position info (`HookHasTargetPosition`, `HookTargetX/Y/Z`) and position-provider support for movement instructions.
- Off-screen command relocation queue service with chunk preload retries, last-known NPC position tracking, and on-load application for unloaded linked NPCs.
- Early asset-pack ordering hook that reorders Tamework directly after `Hytale:Hytale`, replaces conflicting Tamework packs with the plugin jar pack, and removes legacy standalone `Alec's Tamework! (Assets)` packs/archives.
- Command relocation/recall tuning values (hybrid path/teleport thresholds and relocation retry limits) are now configurable via `TwGlobalConfig`.

### Changed
- `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Defend` now delegates non-combat follow behavior through configurable `DefendFollowMacroElement` (defaults to `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Follow_Simple_TP`), so modders can swap in custom follow components without editing Tamework core assets.
- Removed unused legacy parameters from `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Follow_Simple` so the asset only exposes fields that are actually consumed by the simple follow logic.
- Follow seek behavior now tracks the locked `MasterTarget` directly (instead of visibility-dependent player sensors), so follow mode is no longer blocked by grass/occluders.
- `StoreHome` now stores home per NPC in `TameworkCommandLinksComponent` (instead of per-tool metadata), allowing linked NPCs to keep distinct home locations while preserving off-screen return-home relocation support.
- Packaging now embeds `Common/` and `Server/` assets directly in the plugin jar and deploy profiles copy jar-only (no separate `(Assets)` zip).
- Updated Tamework plugin and assets manifests `ServerVersion` to `2026.02.18-f3b8fff95` for latest pre-release server compatibility.

### Fixed
- Corrected `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Defend` instruction structure to avoid defining both `Actions` and `Instructions` on the same instruction node.
- Added `Tamework.Instruction.Follow` interfaces to Tamework follow components and constrained Defend computed follow references to `Hytale.Instruction.Null` or `Tamework.Instruction.Follow` so computed references validate and load correctly.
- HUD popup feedback no longer uses `CustomUIHud`; it now uses the native notification UI channel to avoid custom-HUD ownership conflicts and flicker/crashes from HUD replacement mods.
- Command notifications now use contextual styles: command selection stays `Default`, successful command dispatch uses `Success`, and command dispatch failures use `Warning`.

## 2.0.3 - Example NPC Spawn Fix - 2026-02-18
### Fixed
- Updated Tamework example NPC/template `AttitudeGroup` defaults from `Livestock` to `PreyBig` so `Mob_Tamework_Example` and related examples spawn correctly on current Hytale builds.

## 2.0.2 - Interaction Role Swaps and Naming Items - 2026-02-17
### Added
- Tame interaction option to swap NPC roles after taming via `Role`/`RoleParam`.
- `SetRole` interaction effect for role swaps in any interaction entry.
- New `TwNameItemConfig` asset type under `Server/Tamework/Items/Naming` for naming item rules.
- `TameworkNameNpc` item interaction to start a chat-based naming flow.
- `TameworkNpcNameComponent` to persist custom NPC names and metadata.
- Naming ownership option `AllowUnownedWhenRequireOwner` for owner-or-unowned naming behavior.

### Changed
- Tame checks now treat NPC role ids that start with `Tamed` as tamed for vanilla compatibility (interactions, naming, spawner capture, `TameworkIsTamed`, and `/tw gettamed`).

## 2.0.1 - Pre-release Compatibility Fixes - 2026-02-16
### Fixed
- Spawner capture/spawn now tolerates `CapturedNPCMetadata` getter/setter changes in the pre-release build (prevents `NoSuchMethodError` when resolving roles).
- Interaction floating text/combat text no longer crashes world threads on pre-release builds where `ComponentUpdate` is abstract (uses `CombatTextUpdate` with a compatibility fallback).

## 2.0.0 - Interaction System Overhaul + Global Config - 2026-02-15
### Added
- New **TwInteractionConfig** interaction system with explicit requirements/effects, cooldowns, and configurable priorities.
- Parameterized requirements/effects via role params (ItemsParam, AlarmParam, InteractionContextParam) with role-scope fallback.
- Interaction prompt system (`TameworkInteractPrompt`) with translation keys, prompt selection, and contextual prompt support.
- UI feedback options for interactions: floating text, HUD message overlay (TameworkMessageHud), and mode-cycle messages.
- `AddItemsHand` effect and ItemsParam support for inventory effects.
- Global config asset **TwGlobalConfig** with defaults defined in assets and warnings when fields are missing.
- TameworkHook trigger effect + diagnostics gated by `/tw debughook`, plus `/tw getalarm`.
- Debug toggles for prompts and spawners: `/tw debugprompt` and `/tw debugspawner`.
- Soul lantern shared assets moved into Tamework (spawner example assets updated).
- Build step to copy the jar + assets zip directly to `Hytale\UserData\Mods`.
- Unit tests for interaction parsing, matching, params, cooldowns, and alarms.

### Changed
- Interactions are gated by actual player input; duplicate inputs are deduped by client use time.
- Cooldowns use real time (seconds) and contextual harvest respects cooldowns.
- Interaction config resolution is cached by role and respects Priority overrides.
- Requirements schema updated: ItemsInHand/ItemsInInventory/ItemsEquipped are arrays; equipped slots require arrays.
- Prompt selection prioritizes contextual interactions, refreshes hints on change, detects contextual items, and falls back when contextual entries are blocked.
- Harvest prompt text updated for contextual use (`Use item to harvest`).
- UI message placement/fade tuned for readability.
- Example templates refreshed (state setters for validation, mount anchors, and debug nameplate disabled).

### Removed
- Legacy interaction `Param` aliases.
- Old Tamework settings config file (replaced by TwGlobalConfig assets).

### Fixed
- Harvest prompt gating for alarm readiness (including unset/active handling).
- Alarm evaluation now blocks when world time is unavailable.
- Hook sensor restricted to recent interactions (prevents passive firing).

## 1.2.0 - TwSpawnerConfig Assets + Capture/Spawn Overhaul - 2026-02-09
### Added
- TwSpawnerConfig asset type stored under Server/Tamework/Items/Spawners for spawner item behavior.
- Capture/spawn settings split into Capture and Spawn sections with optional effects (ParticleSystem/SoundEvent) and limits (CooldownMs/MaxDistance).
- Role-scoped icon overrides via IconOverridesByRole alongside default icon overrides.
- Spawner items can capture/spawn using the TameworkSpawn interaction alone (no role interaction chain required), driven by spawner assets.

### Changed
- Allowed roles now default to **Allowlist**; use AllowAll explicitly when needed.
- /tw reloadconfig now reloads spawner config assets from disk.

### Removed
- Legacy Server/Tamework/Tamework_Items_Config.json item config system and per-world overrides.

## 1.1.1 - Follow Component Split - 2026-02-06
### Added
- New follow components split: Follow_Simple_TP (teleport/seek), Follow_Simple (basic follow), and Follow_Advanced (old IdleFollow behavior).
- /tw gettamed and /tw settamed commands to read/flip tamed state.

## 1.1.0 - Core Systems Update - 2026-02-03
### Added
- Owner + Tamed components for NPCs, plus new actions/sensors (set owner, set tamed, owner/stranger/wild capture routing).
- Deny capture while untamed action with optional food list hint (resolves item display names when available).
- Per-mod item config discovery via Server/Tamework/Tamework_Items_Config.json.
- Save-world local overrides for item configs (created empty by default).
- Localization discovery that scans both global Mods and save-world mods.
- Owner utility messaging for denied interactions and untamed capture.
- Assets zip build step for standalone asset distribution (contents of resources + LICENSE.txt).

### Changed
- Tamework example templates updated to match the new capture/tame flow (feed to tame, capture only when tamed).
- Settings/config resolution prefers save-world mods when present, with fallback to global mods.
- Owner name resolution now prefers display name, then username, with UUID fallback.
- /tw getowner now prints owner name + UUID when available.

### Fixed
- Mod discovery null-path issues when running in save-world contexts.
- Missing owner names (messages and getowner previously only showed UUIDs).

### Notes
- Defaults now live in Server/Tamework/Tamework_Items_Config.json (no code-driven defaults).
- Local override configs are intentionally created empty so new items/functions from mod updates are not masked.
