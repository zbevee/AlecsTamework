# Linked Panel Guide

Parent: [Companion Controls](/mod/alecs-tamework/companion-controls) | [Player Guides](/mod/alecs-tamework/player-guides)

The linked panel is the side panel that appears with Tamework command tools. For
ordinary flutes it is an owned-companion panel: every owned companion appears
automatically, while each flute remembers which companions are selected for commands.
The page keeps the historic name because existing links and guides use **Linked Panel**.

![Tamework UI Showcase](https://wiki.hytalemodding.dev/storage/mods/019d3092-1857-713f-86a6-60f15c4e0a9e/files/9d39db03-a1d0-4805-8ded-d1a84d8278e8.jpg)

## What the panel shows
The menu shows **50 cards per page** by default. Use **Previous** and **Next** to
browse the rest. Server owners can set **Command panel cards per page** to 1–100
in `/tw settings`. Search, status tabs, sorting, and group selection still apply
to all your companions. Changing pages does not change which animals receive commands.

Use **? Help** at the top of the command menu to open the **Companion Guide**.
Choose a topic on the left to learn about cards, commands and groups, care,
breeding, traits and talents, capture and coops, finding and recovery, bonded
companions, travel and flight, or world utilities. The guide also covers taming,
ownership, selection, and naming for new players.

Example cards use the same controls as your animals' cards, with made-up names
and numbers. Hover over their bars and icons for help. Use the example's
Previous and Next buttons to see other situations. These cards cannot issue
commands or change your companions. Features and controls depend on the animal pack and
server settings. Use the guide's Back or close button to return to the existing
panel without changing its filters or selection.

- Every owned companion in the current panel, including animals not yet selected on
  that flute. Unsupported roles remain visible with their restriction explained.
- Selected and unselected status, with selected companions listed first
- Loaded, unloaded, captured, housed in a coop, roster-stored,
  provisioned-dormant, dead, or `LOST` state
- Name, species or role label, and often health or cooldown indicators. A custom companion name remains visible after the companion unloads or the world restarts.
- Group membership when the tool uses groups
- Trait or progression indicators when the mod exposes them
- An optional mod-provided capacity summary in the command-menu header
- Animals with aging enabled show a compact life-stage label and age progress
  bar beside breeding and harvest meters, both in the menu and target HUD.
  The age bar fills within the current stage and resets at the next stage;
  paused aging keeps its position. Timers show hours and minutes, then seconds
  when less than one minute remains.
- In some mods, happiness details including current and target trend, plus active impulse modifiers
- A thin red mark on the happiness meter shows the NPC's configured breeding happiness requirement. Hover over the breeding toggle to see the required happiness on the next line.

The panel derives captured, coop, roster-stored, provisioned-dormant, dead, and
`LOST` status from one saved companion lifecycle. Item metadata and an expired
recall timer do not override that status.

## Animal images

Regular NPC cards reuse capture-image rules for current or saved appearance.
Tamework registers hidden display-item aliases for these existing images so the
panel can show them without captured-item metadata or duplicate textures.
These are static images, not live model previews; available variants depend on
the animal pack. Bonded-roster cards use the same capture-image rules for their
saved appearance.

## Bonded roster layout

Bonded rosters have one toolbar with **All**, **Active**, **Stored**, and **Dead**
tabs, name search, and default/name/species sorting. The left column contains
command assignments. Active-capacity information comes from the roster policy;
when several capacity groups apply, hover over the capacity label for details.

Each card keeps the companion's name across the header, with its portrait,
health, traits, level, and talent controls below. These temporary summons do not
show happiness, hunger, or thirst meters. Stored health is muted, and dead
companions retain an empty health bar. The right side shows summon state and the
available **Summon**, **Dismiss**, or **Revive** action with a matching icon.
Finite summon sessions and cooldowns show their remaining time above a progress
bar. Clicking the card's X opens permanent deletion confirmation; **Cancel**
returns to the normal card without deleting the companion.

## Live bonded progression

When a bonded companion is active, its row shows its current level, XP, and
available talent points from that exact live companion. These updates are
grouped so the panel stays responsive while you use its controls. Stored and
dead companions continue to show their saved progression snapshot.

## Talent points

You can open the talent tree for your loaded, tamed companions as soon as you
tame them. They do not need to be selected on the command flute first.

You can open the talent tree and spend or reset points for your dead and `LOST`
companions when Tamework has a complete saved restoration snapshot. Changes are
saved immediately and carry through revival or recovery. In Owned mode, an item
link is not required. Normal talent requirements still apply.

Ordinary unloaded companions must load before you can spend their points. Older
records without a complete saved talent snapshot cannot use offline spending.

## Companion tabs and selection

Ordinary flutes show one owned-companion list with these status tabs. Each tab shows
the number of animals matching your current search and nearby filter; the current
tab has a green highlight:

- **In World**: living companions that are not captured or housed in a coop
- **Stored**: captured or cooped companions
- **Lost / Dead**: companions in either recovery state
- **All**: every owned companion

The panel title shows this flute's selected count and its total displayed records.
The tab counts follow the current **Nearby only** setting and search text, so they
can be lower than your full roster.

Selected companions appear before unselected companions in every tab. The selected
state belongs to the physical flute, so two flutes can keep different working sets.
Left-clicking an owned NPC while holding the flute toggles its selection, and the
selection button on its card does the same. Role, tame, ownership, and per-item
selection limits still apply. A specialized flute can show an owned companion while
explaining that its command set does not support that companion.

Use **Nearby only** to narrow the current tab without changing selection. The search
field matches the companion name, species, or group as one literal search. Tabs,
nearby filtering, search, and sorting only change what is visible; they never change
which companions receive commands.

The separate bonded-companion panel keeps its own roster states and controls.

Capture and cooping preserve the flute's selection. Stored companions do not
receive commands; selection resumes when they return to the world under your
ownership. Carrying a new captured animal does not automatically select it.
Captured cards still let you view and edit your groups, even when capture has
temporarily cleared the animal's ownership. These groups belong to you and do
not grant command control over another player's animal.

Captured and cooped cards show saved health when current and maximum health are
available. Older coop records that saved only a percentage show the storage
label until the animal returns to the world and enters a coop again.

## Finding captured animals

In Linked and Owned modes, captured, cooped, and unloaded animals show location
details directly on their cards, replacing the unused status and cooldown area.
Coop occupants show recorded world and block coordinates; unloaded animals show
their last known location. Loaded animals keep the **Locate** action.

Capture sightings name the item and storage container when known, for example
**Soul Lantern in Wooden Chest**. Player-held items name the carrier; dropped
items show their recorded position. Older sightings use generic labels until
the item or container is observed again.

The Locate window hides unused sections and shrinks to fit. Capture items in a
player's inventory show the holder without empty world or coordinate fields.
Container and dropped-item results include their location and retain last-seen
details when the holder is unloaded.

Inline cards show **World:** and labeled **X**, **Y**, and **Z** coordinates,
without an observation timestamp. Click the copy icon to switch to a selectable
text field containing the plain coordinate tuple; click it again to restore the
labels. When you are in the same world, a line below the coordinates shows rounded
horizontal distances from you, such as **1550m north, 780m west**. These distances
update with the card and use the saved or observed location. Captured animals use
the heading **Captured**. Cards do not load distant chunks or check inventories as they refresh.
The Locate action verifies the recorded holder when available. **Unknown** means
no usable item sighting is available; it does not mean the
animal died or the item was destroyed. Older capture items without a capture receipt
and storage provided by other mods may have no known location.

Item sightings survive normal restarts, but are only hints until verified again.
The tracker uses load and item-change events, with no recurring world or inventory
scans. It keeps a bounded cache, so older sightings can expire from the cache.

## Sorting and filtering
- Sort modes include default order, name, species, group, happiness, hunger, and thirst.
  Selected companions remain first for every sort.
- Care sorts show the lowest percentage first within the selected and unselected sections. Unknown
  values sort last. Unloaded companions use their last-known saved values.
- The ordinary companion panel has a single literal search field for name, species,
  and group. Some legacy tools still expose separate filter modes.

## Selected vs unselected
- Selected companions stay part of normal bulk command dispatch.
- Unselected companions remain owned and visible but are excluded from bulk commands
  on that flute.
- Unselected rows can still appear in the panel so you can manage them individually.
- The group sidebar can quickly select all companions, clear the current flute's
  selection, or select one group's members. Group selection is a one-time operation;
  individual toggles can adjust it afterward.
- Generic companion panels include a `Highlight selected` setting. It starts off.
  When enabled, loaded selected companions show an indicator above their heads
  while you hold that command tool. Only you see the indicator. Its color matches
  each companion's group; ungrouped companions use neutral gold. The indicator
  is hidden while someone rides the companion and returns after dismount.

## Per-row actions
- `Recall`
- `Set Home`
- `Return Home`
- `Revive`, a restoration action for dead or `LOST` companions when the
  companion policy and death cooldown allow it. Roster-backed companions can
  show a confirmation with exact item costs; legacy item-linked flows may be
  free.
- The red X opens `Release` in the generic companion tabs. `Cull` also appears for loaded, living animals. Use the selection toggle to leave an animal out of commands without releasing it.
- `Release` replaces Abandon and permanently frees the ownership slot, including when the animal is off-screen. Loaded animals are removed immediately. Captured animals and coop occupants must leave storage first.
- Action buttons share normal and hovered frames. Flight, shoulder, and breeding icons show the current mode.

## Special statuses
- `Unloaded` means the companion is not currently loaded near you, but the tool still knows about it.
- `Captured` means the companion is stored in its filled capture item. Release
  that item normally or use a supported managed-coop item intake; recall and
  return-home do not replace it.
- `In Coop` means the companion is housed in a configured coop. Release it
  through that coop.
- `Attempting recall` means the tool is retrying relocation for an unloaded
  companion. The timer shows only the remaining retry window. When it ends,
  the attempt stops without inventing a new `LOST` state from timeout or
  absence.
- `Dead` means Tamework saved a confirmed death state. `Revive` becomes
  available when restoration is enabled and the configured cooldown ends.
- `LOST` means Tamework saved a restorable state after confirmed destructive
  removal or world-deletion evidence. It is not inferred solely because the
  companion is off-screen, absent, or took too long to recall.

Captured companions whose ownership was cleared remain visible when carried in your
inventory or already tracked by that flute. These cards are read-only until the
companion is released from storage and owned again. If another player releases a
traded captured companion with ownership reassignment, the former owner's command
links are retired and its old card disappears. The title total includes these
read-only stored records while they are still displayed.

## Group tools
- Groups are shared by the player's ordinary compatible flutes.
- A companion can belong to multiple groups or none. Use the card's native multi-select
  group dropdown to toggle memberships inline; it does not open another page.
- The group manager lets you create, rename, recolor, or delete groups. **Add group**
  opens creation, and **Clear selection** affects only the current flute's recipients.
- Left-click a group to select only its members for the current flute. Right-click
  another group to add its members without clearing your current selection, including
  individually selected animals. Right-clicking from an empty selection selects that
  group. Both actions respect the flute's supported animals and selection limit.
- Groups are highlighted when all their eligible animals are selected. Selecting
  groups does not change group memberships.
- Groups organize the command UI. They do not change companion storage or owner limits.

## Practical tips
- If a companion is dead or `LOST`, use `Revive` when it becomes available
  instead of repeatedly using recall. Review the exact cost confirmation when
  one is configured.
- If a row says `Attempting recall`, let the current attempt finish before
  trying again. An expired countdown is not proof that the companion is lost.
- If a row says `Captured` or `In Coop`, use the matching filled-item or coop
  release interaction.
- If the row stays unselected, check whether you intentionally toggled it off for bulk commands.
- If nearby actions appear only sometimes, move closer and confirm the creature is loaded and owned by you.

Compact cards use separate areas for passive traits and captioned actions. The level sits
above the health bar. Happiness, hunger, thirst, and applicable breeding and harvest
cooldowns share a flat status row; unknown off-screen cooldowns are not shown.
