# Actions, Sensors, and Components

This file maps Tamework's currently registered NPC builders, item interactions, runtime components, and `/tw` commands.

## Targeted Leap Movement

`BodyMotion.Type: "TameworkLeap"` captures its sensor's position when movement
starts and follows a parabolic arc to that exact point. `Duration` defaults to
1.2 seconds and `Height` to 4 blocks above the line between the endpoints. Both
must be positive. It requires a Walk controller and Hytale 0.6.7 or later.

Keep the motion selected for the flight duration. Use a stored position sensor
when target movement or target loss must not change the selected instruction.
After the flight duration, wait for `OnGround` before triggering landing effects.
If the target was airborne, normal gravity completes the descent after the arc.
The destination is not continually updated, so players can dodge after takeoff.

Movement uses the native collision-checked rail step on the NPC's world thread.
Solid blocks stop the arc and normal gravity resumes; other entities do not
shorten it. Deactivating the motion cancels it. The motion creates no system,
scheduled task, persistence, or global entity scan.

## Shared NPC Instruction Components

Use these components from downstream role assets with `Reference` and override
species tuning through `Modify`. Do not copy their instruction bodies into each
mod; consuming the shared IDs lets future Tamework fixes apply automatically.

### `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Flight_Formation`

Optional ambient flight formation around a native flock leader. Exposes
`FlightFormation` (`None`, `Loose`, `Cluster`, `Chevron`), `FlightFormationSpacing` and
`FlightFormationTightness`. Uses the `TameworkFormationFly` controller and
`TameworkFlightFormationReady` to select
`TameworkFlightFormation` only for eligible airborne followers. Keep landing,
escape and commands ahead of it, with normal wandering as a fallback.
See the [Flight Formation Guide](../wiki/Modder-Documentation/System-Integration/Flight-Formation-Guide.md)
for placement, defaults and runtime limits.

`Cluster` uses compact irregular three-dimensional slots with gentle bounded
drift. It keeps the same leader eligibility, obstacle avoidance, speed correction,
and native separation as the other formations.

### `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Flight_Kettle`

Optional daytime thermal circling, separate from travel formations. Place it in
airborne idle after threat, landing and recovery decisions, before ordinary
wandering or formation travel. It falls through while inactive. Defaults:

- `KettleEnabled`: `false`.
- `KettleRadius`: `18` blocks.
- `KettleRelativeSpeed`: `0.8` of maximum flight speed.
- `KettleAltitudeRange`: `[15, 28]` blocks above the native flock leader's home point.
- `KettleCooldownRange`: `[120, 240]` seconds of cooldown after an episode.
- `KettleDurationRange`: `[180, 420]` seconds per episode.
- `DayTimePeriod`: `[6.01, 17.99]`.

The first cooldown is 60–120 seconds; subsequent cooldowns use
`KettleCooldownRange`. The cooldown pauses during an episode and resumes when
eligible idle flight next observes the duration timer stopped. Hosts with timed idle landing should defer
that landing while `Tw_Kettle_Duration` is running, while retaining threat and
recovery priority.

Leaders and lone birds start episodes; native flock beacons invite followers.
`TameworkSetLeashToTargetHome` copies an NPC sensor target's home leash point,
heading, and pitch to the acting NPC. Use an entity-producing sensor such as
`FlockLeader`. For target-based `TameworkFlyingOrbit` movement,
`UseTargetLeashPoint: true` anchors movement to that target NPC's home point
instead of its live position; it defaults to `false`.

`TameworkFlyingOrbit` with `Mode: "Kettle"` circles the leader's home point
(the bird's own home when alone). Each member keeps a deterministic orbit: its
radius ranges from roughly 65% to 150% of `KettleRadius`, its altitude lane
spans 5% to 95% of `KettleAltitudeRange`, and its flight speed ranges from 70%
to 115% of `KettleRelativeSpeed` without exceeding full flight speed. Birds
climb toward their separate lanes at the configured motion limit, so long
episodes do not converge into one circle or altitude. All birds turn in the
same direction. Kettle alternates `Tw_Kettle_Glide` for
10.5 seconds and `Tw_Kettle_Flap` for 1.5 seconds, with member offsets. Models
using Kettle should provide these two animation sets. The movement-slot
override is released on motion deactivation or loss of eligible airborne
movement, restoring normal flight, landing, and walking animation selection. This mode resolves its own center and
does not require a sensor position provider. Existing orbit modes retain their
target-relative behavior.

Motion state is local and resets on activation. Native flock membership and
the home point are read on the NPC's owning world thread; there are no global
scans, background tasks, or saved thermal records. Episode duration continues
to expire through interruptions; the cooldown stays paused until eligible idle
flight observes the episode has ended. A follower invitation expires within one second after
the leader stops kettling. Terrain avoidance can deform the circles. This is
ambient circling, not a simulation of wind or temperature.


### `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Follow_Large`

Ground follow behavior for large NPCs. It seeks its owner at close range,
maintains a configurable separation, and teleports after a configurable maximum
distance. Parameters:

- `MasterTargetSlot`
- `FollowTeleportThresholdRange`
- `FollowSeekSlowDownDistance`
- `FollowSeekStopDistance`
- `FollowMaintainDistanceRange`
- `FollowRelativeSpeed`

```json
{
  "Reference": "Component_Tamework_Instruction_Follow_Large",
  "Modify": {
    "MasterTargetSlot": "MasterTarget",
    "FollowTeleportThresholdRange": 60,
    "FollowSeekSlowDownDistance": 32,
    "FollowSeekStopDistance": 16,
    "FollowMaintainDistanceRange": [16, 24],
    "FollowRelativeSpeed": 1
  }
}
```

### `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Follow_Flying`

Autonomous flying follow behavior that takes off from `Walk`, maintains a
target-relative altitude, wanders around its owner with
`TameworkFlyingOrbit`, teleports after extreme separation, and hovers safely
when the owner target is temporarily unavailable.

In Adventure mode, `Follow` first uses the shared companion formation. Its
`TameworkFlyingOrbit` `FOLLOW_FORMATION` mode slows in three dimensions and
allows birds to settle near their targets. The group ignores small owner
steps and height changes. See the
[companion follow guide](../wiki/Modder-Documentation/System-Integration/Companion-Follow-Formation.md).

Parameters:

- `MasterTargetSlot`
- `FollowDesiredAltitudeRange`
- `FollowTeleportThresholdRange`
- `FollowOrbitRadiusRange`
- `FollowOrbitRetargetTimeRange`
- `FollowOrbitStopDistance`
- `FollowOrbitRelativeSpeed`
- `FollowHoverRadius`
- `FollowHoverRelativeSpeed`

```json
{
  "Reference": "Component_Tamework_Instruction_Follow_Flying",
  "Modify": {
    "MasterTargetSlot": "MasterTarget",
    "FollowDesiredAltitudeRange": [4, 8],
    "FollowTeleportThresholdRange": 60,
    "FollowOrbitRadiusRange": [16, 24],
    "FollowOrbitRetargetTimeRange": [3, 6],
    "FollowOrbitStopDistance": 3,
    "FollowOrbitRelativeSpeed": 0.65,
    "FollowHoverRadius": 1.75,
    "FollowHoverRelativeSpeed": 0.12
  }
}
```

### `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Hold_Flying`

Flying Hold behavior for companions using Tamework's managed landing
controller. It releases combat, waits for the landing controller to complete,
applies a grounded animation once, and remains stationary after touchdown.
Parameters:

- `HoldGroundAnimation`
- `HoldLandingSearchRange`
- `HoldLandingSearchAngle`
- `HoldLandingSlowDownDistance`
- `HoldLandingStopDistance`
- `HoldLandingGoalLenience`

```json
{
  "Reference": "Component_Tamework_Instruction_Hold_Flying",
  "Modify": {
    "HoldGroundAnimation": "Idle"
  }
}
```

### `Component_Tamework_Instruction_SeekFood_PlayerFollow_Flying`

Aerial counterpart to `Component_Tamework_Instruction_SeekFood_PlayerFollow`.
It pursues a non-hostile player holding an attractive item, lands safely near
the target, approaches on foot, and returns to the imported `Idle` parent state
when the item is lost. Parameters:

- `_ImportStates`
- `AttractiveItemSet`
- `FollowTargetSlot`
- `LandingPositionSlot`
- `FlightSeekStopDistance`
- `GroundApproachDistanceRange`

```json
{
  "Reference": "Component_Tamework_Instruction_SeekFood_PlayerFollow_Flying",
  "Modify": {
    "AttractiveItemSet": ["Food_Fish_Raw"],
    "FollowTargetSlot": "LockedTarget",
    "LandingPositionSlot": "MyMod_Aerial_Favorite_Landing",
    "FlightSeekStopDistance": 5,
    "GroundApproachDistanceRange": [1.5, 2]
  }
}
```

### `Component_Tamework_Instruction_Airborne_Mode_Transition`

Parameterized autonomous transition between native `Walk` and `Fly` motion
controllers. It consumes a downstream hook, toggles an airborne flag, respects
a grounded-activity gate, and performs takeoff or safe ray-based landing.
Parameters:

- `ToggleAirborneModeHookId`
- `AirborneModeFlagName`
- `GroundedActivityFlagName`
- `LandingRayName`
- `LandingBlocks`
- `LandingSearchRange`
- `LandingSearchAngle`
- `LandingSlowDownDistance`
- `LandingStopDistance`
- `LandingHeightDifference`
- `LandingGoalLenience`
- `LandingDesiredAltitudeWeight`

Consumers without a grounded activity should use a private flag name that they
never set; the component's `Set: false` gate then remains open.

```json
{
  "Reference": "Component_Tamework_Instruction_Airborne_Mode_Transition",
  "Modify": {
    "ToggleAirborneModeHookId": "MyMod.Command.ToggleAirborneMode",
    "AirborneModeFlagName": "AirborneMode",
    "GroundedActivityFlagName": "MyMod_UnusedGroundedActivity",
    "LandingRayName": "MyMod_AirborneMode_LandingRay"
  }
}
```

## NPC Action Builder IDs
- `TameworkInteract`: Runs the optimized interaction pipeline (`TwInteractionConfig`).
- `TameworkInteractPrompt`: Updates prompt text from the first currently matching interaction entry.
- `TameworkCaptureOwner`: Captures an owned NPC into a spawner item.
- `TameworkCaptureStranger`: Captures another player's owned NPC when policy allows.
- `TameworkCaptureWild`: Captures untamed NPCs.
- `TameworkConfirmLanding`: Switches a flying NPC to its `Walk` controller after the active
  flight controller reports physical ground contact. Use it with an `OnGround` sensor when a
  large or pitched collision box can touch terrain before the base `Land` motion reaches its
  positional goal.
- `TameworkDenyCaptureUntamed`: Blocks capture when tame is required.
- `TameworkDenyInteract`: Blocks player interaction (typically non-owner gating).
- `TameworkSetOwner`: Assigns owner from the interacting player. Vanilla action lists that also
  tame or consume an item should configure `TameOnApplied`, `ConsumeHeldItemOnApplied`,
  `StateOnApplied`, `ParticleSystemOnApplied`, and `SoundEventParamOnApplied` on this action. Those
  effects then run only from the admitted owner-mutation continuation; do not add eager sibling
  inventory/tame success actions to the same list.
- `TameworkSetTamed`: Sets/clears tamed state.
- `TameworkNeedsResourceConsume`: Consumes configured needs resource targets (food/water seek flows).
- `TameworkNeedsResourceRejectTarget`: Temporarily suppresses a failed needs seek target so later scans can choose another reachable source.
- `TameworkNeedsResourceReleaseTarget`: Releases a successful needs seek target reservation without marking it as failed.
- `TameworkForgetHostileTarget`: Removes the current sensor target from hostile target memory so it cannot be reacquired.
- `TameworkRejectPositionTarget`: Temporarily suppresses a failed generic position target for the current NPC.
- `TameworkHarvestDrop`: Drops harvest outputs with trait-aware bonus support.
- `TameworkDebugMessage`: Emits debug text from instruction flows.

## NPC Sensor Builder IDs
- `TameworkIsOwner`
- `TameworkHasOwner`
- `TameworkIsTamed`
- `TameworkLifeStage`
- `TameworkAlarm` (mirrors base `Alarm` sensor syntax for Tamework alarms: `Name`, `State`, optional `Clear`)
- `TameworkHook`
- `TameworkEffectActive` (checks active `EntityEffect` with optional `MinRemainingSeconds`)
- `TameworkHasTalent` (checks this NPC's purchased talent ID, for example `{ "Type": "TameworkHasTalent", "TalentId": "DraconicProjectile" }`)
- `TameworkNeedBelow`
- `TameworkNeedsResourceFastMode`: Matches while `/tw settings` has active needs fast-consume behavior.
- `TameworkNeedsResourceTarget`
- `TameworkReachableBlockTarget` (finds a matching block set or exact block type, exposes a projected and path-preflighted approach position)

`TameworkNeedsResourceTarget` reads short-lived local targets and shared area
results before it requests new work. A cold lookup can return `false` for one
or more world ticks while the bounded resource-search worker processes it.
Later sensor checks use the shared result immediately. Equivalent requests from
nearby NPCs share one cold search, while rejection and reservation filters stay
specific to each NPC.

`TameworkHook` context fields:
- `HookId`
- `HookPlayerId`
- `HookPlayerName`
- `HookHeldItemId`
- `HookTimestampMs`
- `HookHasTargetPosition`
- `HookTargetX`
- `HookTargetY`
- `HookTargetZ`

## NPC Entity Filter Builder IDs
- `TameworkAttitudeFromTargetSlot` (checks a candidate NPC's attitude toward a marked target slot)
- `TameworkAttackedTargetSlotRecently`

## Runtime ECS Components
- `TameworkOwnerComponent`
- `TameworkTamedComponent`
- `TameworkHookComponent`
- `TameworkNpcNameComponent`
- `TameworkMountedNameplateComponent`
- `TameworkCommandLinksComponent`
- `TameworkHappinessComponent`
- `TameworkNeedsComponent`
- `TameworkBreedingComponent`
- `TameworkTraitsComponent`
- `TameworkAttachmentsComponent`
- `TameworkLifeStageComponent`
- `TameworkAvatarFlightMountSession` (player-side NPC/config link, phase, origin, last safe ground, and dismount hold state)
- `TameworkAvatarFlightSource` (source-NPC reverse link and role/transform/visibility recovery snapshot)

- `/tw debug view spawn-markers [radius|off]`
- `/tw debug delete-spawn-marker [range]`
- `/tw debug clear-owned [self|player|UUID] [confirm]`

`NPC selectors` use Hytale's standard NPC debug selection: `--world`, `--entity`, `--angle`,
`--range`, `--roles`, `--nearest`, `--ray`, `--cone`, `--coneAll`, and `--sphere`.

## Notes
- Components persist across reloads.
- `TriggerNpcHook` + `TameworkHook` is the primary bridge from optimized interactions into instruction branches.
- `TameworkAlarm` is the instruction-side reset bridge for durable Tamework alarm state.
- `TameworkEffectActive` is useful for gating behavior while status effects (for example tranquilizer) are active.
- `/tw config reload` only reloads item-feature assets (`TwSpawnerConfig`, `TwNameItemConfig`, `TwCommandItemConfig`).

## TameworkBossBar

Update 6 NPC action that shows the native boss health bar to nearby players.
Use it in a continuing combat instruction. `Range` defaults to 40 blocks;
`Name` is an optional localization key (otherwise the native display name is used).
Membership refreshes every 0.25 seconds using the world's player spatial index.
The native encounter member system expires viewers after 0.75 seconds without
a refresh, including when combat ends or NPC AI stops on death. Entity removal
and unload explicitly hide the bar. This attaches only native membership and
boss-bar components; it does not replace NPC role support with an encounter.

```json
{ "Continue": true, "Actions": [{ "Type": "TameworkBossBar", "Range": 40, "Name": "server.npcRoles.MyBoss.name" }] }
```


## TameworkBeam

Update 6 and later. Repeats a terrain-clipped particle beam along the NPC's
current head direction while the action is active. The role owns attack timing
and turning: use `HeadMotion: Aim` with a low `RelativeTurnSpeed` and
`BodyMotion: MatchLook` to create a dodgeable sweep. The action never aims directly
at the target. Losing the locked target or dying stops emission and damage.

`Range` limits the beam length, `Damage` is damage per tick, and
`DamageInterval` sets tick spacing in seconds. Zero damage is supported for a
harmless charge effect. Only player collision boxes are hit, through the native
damage pipeline. Terrain clips both damage and visuals.

`ParticleSystem` names a short-lived beam effect centered at its emitter and
aligned to local Z. `ParticleNativeLength` is its full authored length at scale
one. The effect is scaled to the clipped distance and emitted at the midpoint
at most ten times per second. Particle lifetime should be about 0.11 seconds.
`OriginHeight` and `OriginForward` position the source relative to the NPC;
`BeamRadius` widens player collision checks. Intervals do not catch up with
multiple damage ticks after a stall. State changes leave only the short-lived
visual tail, with no deferred damage or background worker.
